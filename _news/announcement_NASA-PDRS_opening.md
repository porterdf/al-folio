New Job Opening
======
<br/><img src='/assets/img/ross-ice-front_fromLC130.JPG'><br/>
(View of Ross Ice Shelf front from an LC130 from the ROSETTA-Ice survey.)

Come work with myself and Drs. Jonny Kingslake, Kirsty Tinto, and Renata Constantino to conduct research in the field of glacier geophysics and ice sheet modeling. We will use data from NASA Operation IceBridge and ROSETTA-Ice aerogeophysical campaigns over the Ross Ice Shelf, remote sensing (e.g. satellite altimetry from ICESat-II), and numerical modeling to **better understand the vulnerability of Antarctic ice shelves due to channelized melting**. You wil have the opportunity to take a leading role in ice flow model development, with potential linkages to existing Pangeo projects and the NCAR climate model ecosystem.
