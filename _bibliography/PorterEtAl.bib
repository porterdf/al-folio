	abstract = {For generations, climate scientists have educated the public that ‘weather is not climate’, and climate change has been framed as the change in the distribution of weather that slowly emerges from large variability over decades1–7. However, weather when considered globally is now in uncharted territory. Here we show that on the basis of a single day of globally observed temperature and moisture, we detect the fingerprint of externally driven climate change, and conclude that Earth as a whole is warming. Our detection approach invokes statistical learning and climate model simulations to encapsulate the relationship between spatial patterns of daily temperature and humidity, and key climate change metrics such as annual global mean temperature or Earth’s energy imbalance. Observations are projected onto this relationship to detect climate change. The fingerprint of climate change is detected from any single day in the observed global record since early 2012, and since 1999 on the basis of a year of data. Detection is robust even when ignoring the long-term global warming trend. This complements traditional climate change detection, but also opens broader perspectives for the communication of regional weather events, modifying the climate change narrative: while changes in weather locally are emerging over decades, global climate change is now detected instantaneously. Detection and attribution typically aims to find long-term climate signals in internal, often short-term variability. Here, common methods are extended to high-frequency temperature and humidity data, detecting instantaneous, global-scale climate change since 1999 for any year and 2012 for any day.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, meltwater runoff has accelerated to become the dominant mechanism for mass loss in the Greenland ice sheet1–3. In Greenland’s high-elevation interior, porous snow and firn accumulate; these can absorb surface meltwater and inhibit runoff4, but this buffering effect is limited if enough water refreezes near the surface to restrict percolation5,6. However, the influence of refreezing on runoff from Greenland remains largely unquantified. Here we use firn cores, radar observations and regional climate models to show that recent increases in meltwater have resulted in the formation of metres-thick, low-permeability ‘ice slabs’ that have expanded the Greenland ice sheet’s total runoff area by 26 ± 3 per cent since 2001. Although runoff from the top of ice slabs has added less than one millimetre to global sea-level rise so far, this contribution will grow substantially as ice slabs expand inland in a warming climate. Runoff over ice slabs is set to contribute 7 to 33 millimetres and 17 to 74 millimetres to global sea-level rise by 2100 under moderate- and high-emissions scenarios, respectively—approximately double the estimated runoff from Greenland’s high-elevation interior, as predicted by surface mass balance models without ice slabs. Ice slabs will have an important role in enhancing surface meltwater feedback processes, fundamentally altering the ice sheet’s present and future hydrology. Observations and regional climate models show that the increasing coverage of ice slabs on the Greenland ice sheet could lead to a global sea-level rise of up to 74 millimetres by 2100.},

	abstract = {How fast does warm ocean water melt glaciers that terminate in the sea? That question is central to understanding how fast ice sheets may lose mass, and thus how fast sea level will rise, in response to global warming, but there are few data about the process. Sutherland et al. used repeat multibeam sonar surveys to observe an Alaskan subsurface tidewater glacier face to create a time series of its melting and calving patterns. They observed melt rates up to a hundred times larger than those predicted by theory, observations that compel us to reevaluate predictions of such ice loss.

Science , this issue p. [369][1]

Ice loss from the world’s glaciers and ice sheets contributes to sea level rise, influences ocean circulation, and affects ecosystem productivity. Ongoing changes in glaciers and ice sheets are driven by submarine melting and iceberg calving from tidewater glacier margins. However, predictions of glacier change largely rest on unconstrained theory for submarine melting. Here, we use repeat multibeam sonar surveys to image a subsurface tidewater glacier face and document a time-variable, three-dimensional geometry linked to melting and calving patterns. Submarine melt rates are high across the entire ice face over both seasons surveyed and increase from spring to summer. The observed melt rates are up to two orders of magnitude greater than predicted by theory, challenging current simulations of ice loss from tidewater glaciers.

We propose re-framing the treatment of climate change in policy and research, to make sure health, poverty, education, cultural vitality, equity, justice, and other topics highlighted by the people themselves and not just climate science also get the attention they deserve in research on global and regional environmental change. Climate change can often exacerbate other problems, but a singular focus on climate change—as is often the case in much existing environmental literature on the Arctic and elsewhere—can distract from actions that can be taken now to improve the lives of Arctic peoples. The same logic also applies elsewhere in the world, where diverse residents face a host of challenges, opportunities, and obstacles, with climate change but one among many issues. Our proposed approach to regional and global environmental change research draws on the ideas of decolonization, emphasizing collaborative approaches and Indigenous voices in research and policy instead of top-down measures designed outside the affected communities. Only in this way of contextualizing human-environmental experiences can the full effects of climate change be understood—and appropriate responses developed and carried out to adapt to global change.},

Here we use atmospheric, oceanographic and glaciological time series data from the ice shelf of Petermann Gletscher, NW Greenland to quantify the forcing of the ocean and atmosphere on the ice shelf at a site {\textasciitilde}16 km from the grounding line within a large sub-ice-shelf channel. Basal melt rates here indicate a strong seasonality, rising from a winter mean of 2 m a−1 to a maximum of 80 m a−1 during the summer melt season. This increase in basal melt rates confirms the direct link between summer atmospheric warming around Greenland and enhanced ocean-forced melting of its remaining ice shelves. We attribute this enhanced melting to increased discharge of subglacial runoff into the ocean at the grounding line, which strengthens under-ice currents and drives a greater ocean heat flux toward the ice base.},

Why buy a book you can download for free? We print this book so you don't have to. First you gotta find a good clean (legible) copy and make sure it's the latest version (not always easy). If you find a good copy, you could print it using a network printer you share with 100 other people (typically its either out of paper or toner). If it's just a 10-page document, no problem, but if it's 250-pages, you will need to punch 3 holes in all those pages and put it in a 3-ring binder. Takes at least an hour. It's much more cost-effective to just order the latest version from Amazon.com Why buy an eBook when you can access data on a website for free? HYPERLINKS Anyone that has worked with large scientific documents knows how difficult it is to search to find that one bit of critical information. Yes, the book is available as a PDF file, but do you really want to search a PDF document manually? (Unfortunately, downloading the free sample file at Amazon.com does not include this feature. You have to buy a copy to get that functionality, but as inexpensive as this is, it's worth it.) Kindle allows you to do word search and Page Flip (temporary place holder takes you back when you want to go back and check something). Load this copy onto your Kindle, PC, iPad, Android Tablet, Nook, or iPhone (download the FREE kindle App from the APP Store) and you have an easily searchable copy. We recommend the Kindle Paperwhite. It's inexpensive, has long battery life (weeks) and can hold a lot of documents. https: //usgovpub.com},

	doi = {10.5194/tc-13-545-2019-supplement},
	abstract = {Abstract. The recent rapid growth of rifts in the Brunt Ice Shelf appears to
signal the onset of its largest calving event since records began in 1915.
The aim of this study is to determine whether this calving event will lead to
a new steady state in which the Brunt Ice Shelf remains in contact with the bed,
or an unpinning from the bed, which could predispose it to accelerated flow
or possible break-up. We use a range of geophysical data to reconstruct the
sea-floor bathymetry and ice shelf geometry, to examine past ice sheet
configurations in the Brunt Basin, and to define the present-day geometry of
the contact between the Brunt Ice Shelf and the bed. Results show that during
past ice advances grounded ice streams likely converged in the Brunt Basin
from the south and east. As the ice retreated, it was likely pinned on at
least three former grounding lines marked by topographic highs, and
transverse ridges on the flanks of the basin. These may have subsequently
formed pinning points for developing ice shelves. The ice shelf geometry and
bathymetry measurements show that the base of the Brunt Ice Shelf now only
makes contact with one of these topographic highs. This contact is limited to
an area of less than 1.3 to 3 km2 and results in a compressive regime
that helps to maintain the ice shelf's integrity. The maximum overlap between ice shelf
draft and the bathymetric high is 2–25 m and is contingent on the presence
of incorporated iceberg keels, which protrude beneath the base of the ice
shelf. The future of the ice shelf depends on whether the expected calving
event causes full or partial loss of contact with the bed and whether the
subsequent response causes re-grounding within a predictable period or a
loss of structural integrity resulting from properties inherited at the
grounding line.},

	abstract = {Subglacial discharge plumes increase submarine melting of marine-terminating glaciers significantly; however, in-situ data on their properties and behaviour are limited. We present oceanographic data collected by ringed seals (Pusa hispida) instrumented with GPS-equipped conductivity-temperature-depth satellite relay data loggers (GPS-CTD-SRDLs) in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, during 2012. The seals foraged just outside the plumes and collected hydrographic data from within the plumes’ upwelling cores as they returned to the surface. The seals encountered water with fractions of subglacial discharge as high as 27\% at 60 m below the ocean surface. The ringed seals responded rapidly to spatial and temporal variations in subglacial discharge at the glacier terminus, suggesting that prey becomes available quickly following the appearance of plumes. The seals’ dive locations were used to monitor the presence of plumes over a four-month period. High surface runoff from Kronebreen catchment created strong plumes, but weak plumes were present even during periods of low surface runoff. The continued retreat of Kronebreen, and other tidewater glaciers, will lead to the loss of these marine-termini as the glaciers retreat onto land. The techniques presented here improve our understanding of the drivers of glacial retreat and the implications of future habitat loss for glacier-associated birds and mammals.},

	abstract = {Over the past 34 Million years, the Antarctic continental shelf has gradually deepened due to ice sheet loading, thermal subsidence, and erosion from repeated glaciations. The deepening that is recorded in the sedimentary deposits around the Antarctic margin indicates that after the mid-Miocene Climate Optimum (≈15 Ma), Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) dynamical response to climate conditions changed. We explore end-members for maximum AIS extent, based on ice-sheet simulations of a late-Pleistocene and a mid-Miocene glaciation. Fundamental dynamical differences emerge as a consequence of atmospheric forcing, eustatic sea level and continental shelf evolution. We show that the AIS contributed to the amplification of its own sensitivity to ocean forcing by gradually expanding and eroding the continental shelf, that probably changed its tipping points through time. The lack of past topographic and bathymetric reconstructions implies that so far, we still have an incomplete understanding of AIS fast response to past warm climate conditions, which is crucial to constrain its future evolution.},

We used observations from an automatic weather station at Cabinet Inlet on the northern Larsen C ice shelf between 25 November 2014 and 31 December 2016 to describe föhn dynamics. Observed föhn frequency was compared to the latest version of the regional climate model RACMO2.3p2, run over the Antarctic Peninsula at 5.5-km horizontal resolution. A föhn identification scheme based on observed wind conditions was employed to check for model biases in föhn representation. Seasonal variation in total föhn event duration was resolved with sufficient skill. The analysis was extended to the model period (1979–2016) to obtain a multidecadal perspective of föhn occurrence over Larsen C ice shelf. Föhn occurrence at Cabinet Inlet strongly correlates with near-surface air temperature, and both are found to relate strongly to the location and strength of the Amundsen Sea Low. Furthermore, we demonstrated that föhn occurrence over Larsen C ice shelf shows high variability in space and time.},

A 20\% increase in wind speed, with no other atmospheric changes, reduced summer sea ice minimum area by 20\%, opposite the observed trend of the past three decades. Increased winds with spatially uniform, reduced atmospheric temperatures increased summer sea ice concentrations, on-shelf transport of CDW, vertical mixing of MCDW, HSSW volume, and (albeit small) RIS basal melt. Winds and atmospheric temperatures from the SRES A1B scenario forcing of the MPI ECHAM5 model decreased on-shelf transport of CDW and vertical mixing of MCDW for 2046–61 and 2085–2100 relative to the end of the twentieth cent...},

	abstract = {Satellite observations over the past two decades have revealed increasing loss of grounded ice in West Antarctica, associated with floating ice shelves that have been thinning. Thinning reduces an ice shelf’s ability to restrain grounded-ice discharge, yet our understanding of the climate processes that drive mass changes is limited. Here, we use ice-shelf height data from four satellite altimeter missions (1994–2017) to show a direct link between ice-shelf height variability in the Antarctic Pacific sector and changes in regional atmospheric circulation driven by the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. This link is strongest from the Dotson to Ross ice shelves and weaker elsewhere. During intense El Niño years, height increase by accumulation exceeds the height decrease by basal melting, but net ice-shelf mass declines as basal ice loss exceeds ice gain by lower-density snow. Our results demonstrate a substantial response of Amundsen Sea ice shelves to global and regional climate variability, with rates of change in height and mass on interannual timescales that can be comparable to the longer-term trend, and with mass changes from surface accumulation offsetting a significant fraction of the changes in basal melting. This implies that ice-shelf height and mass variability will increase as interannual atmospheric variability increases in a warming climate.},

	abstract = {Although the Greenland ice sheet is losing mass as a whole, patterns of change on both local and regional scales are complex. Spatial statistics reveal large spatial variability of dynamic thinning rates of Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers between 2003 and 2009; only 18\% of glacier thinning rates co-vary with neighboring glaciers. Most spatially-correlated thinning rates are clusters of stable glaciers in the Thule, Scoresby Sund, and Southwest regions. Conversely, where spatial-autocorrelation is low, individual glaciers are more strongly controlled by local, glacier-scale features than by regional influences. We investigate possible sources of local control of oceanic forcing by combining grounding line depths and ocean model output to estimate mean ocean heat content adjacent to 74 glaciers. Linear regression models indicate stronger correlation of dynamic thinning rates with ocean heat content compared to those with grounding line depths alone. The correlation between ocean heat and dynamic thinning is robust for all of Greenland except glaciers in the West, and strongest in the Southeast (coefficient of determination of 0.81), implying that glaciers with deeper grounded termini here are most sensitive to changes in ocean forcing. In the Northwest, accounting for shallow sills in the regressions improves the correlation of water depth with glacial thinning, highlighting the need for comprehensive knowledge of fjord geometry.},

can cause upstream acceleration of grounded ice and raise global sea levels. So far the effect has not been quantified in a comprehensive and spatially explicit manner. Here, using a finite-element model, we diagnose the immediate, continent-wide flux response to different spatial patterns of ice-shelf mass loss. We show that highly localized ice-shelf thinning can reach across the entire shelf and accelerate ice flow in regions far from the initial perturbation. As an example, this ‘tele-buttressing’ enhances outflow from Bindschadler Ice Stream in response to thinning near Ross Island more than 900 km away. We further find that the integrated flux response across all grounding lines is highly dependent on the location of imposed changes: the strongest response is caused not only near ice streams and ice rises, but also by thinning, for instance, well-within the Filchner–Ronne and Ross Ice Shelves. The most critical regions in all major ice shelves are often located in regions easily accessible to the intrusion of warm ocean waters

Here, we present a preliminary high-resolution analysis of the tsunamigenic landslide scar based on three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of oblique aerial photographs taken during a post-failure reconnaissance helicopter overflight. Through a 3D quantitative comparison with pre-failure topography, we estimate that approximately 58 million m3 of rock and colluvium (talus) was mobilized during the landslide, 45 million m3 of which reached the fjord, resulting in a destructive tsunami. We classify this event as a “tsunamigenic extremely rapid rock avalanche,” which likely released along a pre-existing metamorphic fabric, bounded laterally by slope-scale faults. Further analysis is required to properly characterize this landslide and adjacent unstable slopes, and to better understand the tsunami generation.},

	abstract = {Liquid freshwater fluxes from the Greenland ice sheet affect ocean water properties and circulation on local, regional and basin-wide scales, with associated biosphere effects. The exact impact, however, depends on the volume, timing and location of freshwater releases, which are poorly known. In particular, the transformation of icebergs, which make up roughly 30–50\% of the loss of the ice-sheet mass to liquid freshwater, is not well understood. Here we estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of the freshwater flux for the Helheim–Sermilik glacier–fjord system in southeast Greenland using an iceberg-melt model that resolves the subsurface iceberg melt. By estimating seasonal variations in all the freshwater sources, we confirm quantitatively that iceberg melt is the largest annual freshwater source in this system type. We also show that 68–78\% of the iceberg melt is released below a depth of 20 m and, seasonally, about 40–100\% of that melt is likely to remain at depth, in contrast with the usual model assumptions. Iceberg melt also peaks two months after all the other freshwater sources peak. Our methods provide a framework to assess individual freshwater sources in any tidewater system, and our results are particularly applicable to coastal regions with a high solid-ice discharge in Greenland.},

	abstract = {Totten Glacier in East Antarctica has the potential to raise global sea level by at least 3.5 m, but its sensitivity to climate change has not been well understood. The glacier is coupled to the ocean by the Totten Ice Shelf, which has exhibited variable speed, thickness, and grounding line position in recent years. To understand the drivers of this interannual variability, we compare ice velocity to oceanic wind stress and find a consistent pattern of ice-shelf acceleration 19 months after upwelling anomalies occur at the continental shelf break nearby. The sensitivity to climate forcing we observe is a response to wind-driven redistribution of oceanic heat and is independent of large-scale warming of the atmosphere or ocean. Our results establish a link between the stability of Totten Glacier and upwelling near the East Antarctic coast, where surface winds are projected to intensify over the next century as a result of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.},

Here, the central physical processes that determine iceberg motion are investigated. This is done through the development and analysis of an idealized model of iceberg drift. The model is forced with high-resolution surface velocity and temperature data from an observational state estimate. It retains much of the most salient physics, while remaining sufficiently simple to allow insight into the details of how icebergs drift. An analytical solution of the model is derived, which highlights how iceberg drift patterns depend on iceberg size, ocean current velocity, and wind velocity. A long-standing rule of thumb for Arctic icebergs estimates their drift velocity to be 2\% of the wind velocity relative to the ocean current. Here, this relationship is derived from first principles, and it is shown that the relationship holds in the limit of ...},

	doi = {10.1126/sciadv.1700584},
	abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has been losing mass at an accelerating rate since the mid-1990s. This has been due to both increased ice discharge into the ocean and melting at the surface, with the latter being the dominant contribution. This change in state has been attributed to rising temperatures and a decrease in surface albedo. We show, using satellite data and climate model output, that the abrupt reduction in surface mass balance since about 1995 can be attributed largely to a coincident trend of decreasing summer cloud cover enhancing the melt-albedo feedback. Satellite observations show that, from 1995 to 2009, summer cloud cover decreased by 0.9 ± 0.3\% per year. Model output indicates that the GrIS summer melt increases by 27 ± 13 gigatons (Gt) per percent reduction in summer cloud cover, principally because of the impact of increased shortwave radiation over the low albedo ablation zone. The observed reduction in cloud cover is strongly correlated with a state shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation promoting anticyclonic conditions in summer and suggests that the enhanced surface mass loss from the GrIS is driven by synoptic-scale changes in Arctic-wide atmospheric circulation.},

They show that surface water can be transported more than 100 kilometres, creating pond networks almost 80 kilometres long. Although the implications of the findings for ice-sheet dynamics are not explored, the study demonstrates that surface water drainage is more extensive than previously thought, and is probably a persistent feature of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Elsewhere in this issue, Robin Bell et al. report on the influence of surface meltwater on Antarctic ice-shelf stability and find that it might not be a universally destructive force as was previously thought.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06870},
	doi = {10.1016/j.ocemod.2017.07.003},
	abstract = {Although iceberg models have been used for decades, they have received far more widespread attention in recent years, in part due to efforts to explicitly represent icebergs in climate models. This calls for increased scrutiny of all aspects of typical iceberg models. An important component of iceberg models is the representation of iceberg capsizing, or rolling. Rolling occurs spontaneously when the ratio of iceberg width to height falls below a critical threshold. Here we examine previously proposed representations of this threshold, and we find that there have been crucial errors in the representation of rolling in many modeling studies to date. We correct these errors and identify an accurate model representation of iceberg rolling. Next, we assess how iceberg rolling influences simulation results in a hierarchy of models. Rolling is found to substantially prolong the lifespan of individual icebergs and allow them to drift farther offshore, although it is found to have relatively small impacts on the large-scale freshwater distribution in comprehensive model simulations. The results suggest that accurate representations of iceberg rolling may be of particular importance for operational forecast models of iceberg drift, as well as for regional changes in high-resolution climate model simulations.},

The Totten Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, which buttresses a marine-based ice sheet with a volume equivalent to at least 3.5 m of global sea-level rise, also experiences rapid basal melt, but the role of ocean forcing was not known because of a lack of observations near the ice shelf. Observations from the Totten calving front confirm that (0.22 ± 0.07) × 106 m3 s−1 of warm water enters the cavity through a newly discovered deep channel. The ocean heat transport into the cavity is sufficient to support the large basal melt rates inferred from glaciological observations. Change in ocean heat flux is a plausible physical mechanism to explain past and projected changes in this sector of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and its contribution to sea level.},

	doi = {10.1016/S1569-4860(01)80019-X},
	abstract = {Many glaciers and ice shelves in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are retreating or thinning rapidly, but the triggering mechanism has been unclear; now, the retreat of Pine Island Glacier is found to have begun in the 1940s following warming El Niño events in the Pacific Ocean, showing that glacial retreat can continue long after an initial push from the climate. Many glaciers and ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea sector of the Antarctic Ice Sheet are retreating or thinning rapidly, but to date the initial triggering mechanism has been unclear. James Smith and colleagues now show that Pine Island Glacier's exceptional retreat began in the 1940s, following a pulse of warmth associated with El Niño events in the tropical Pacific, thereby confirming that glacial retreat can persist well after the initial push from climate. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the largest potential sources of rising sea levels1. Over the past 40 years, glaciers flowing into the Amundsen Sea sector of the ice sheet have thinned at an accelerating rate2, and several numerical models suggest that unstable and irreversible retreat of the grounding line—which marks the boundary between grounded ice and floating ice shelf—is underway3. Understanding this recent retreat requires a detailed knowledge of grounding-line history4, but the locations of the grounding line before the advent of satellite monitoring in the 1990s are poorly dated. In particular, a history of grounding-line retreat is required to understand the relative roles of contemporaneous ocean-forced change and of ongoing glacier response to an earlier perturbation in driving ice-sheet loss. Here we show that the present thinning and retreat of Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica is part of a climatically forced trend that was triggered in the 1940s. Our conclusions arise from analysis of sediment cores recovered beneath the floating Pine Island Glacier ice shelf, and constrain the date at which the grounding line retreated from a prominent seafloor ridge. We find that incursion of marine water beyond the crest of this ridge, forming an ocean cavity beneath the ice shelf, occurred in 1945 (±12 years); final ungrounding of the ice shelf from the ridge occurred in 1970 (±4 years). The initial opening of this ocean cavity followed a period of strong warming of West Antarctica, associated with El Niño activity. Thus our results suggest that, even when climate forcing weakened, ice-sheet retreat continued.},

Glaciers retreating along retrograde slopes (that is, the bed elevation drops in the inland direction) are potentially unstable, while subglacial ridges slow down the glacial retreat. Despite major advances in the mapping of subglacial bed topography, significant sectors of Antarctica remain poorly resolved and critical spatial details are missing. Here we present a novel, high-resolution and physically based description of Antarctic bed topography using mass conservation. Our results reveal previously unknown basal features with major implications for glacier response to climate change. For example, glaciers flowing across the Transantarctic Mountains are protected by broad, stabilizing ridges. Conversely, in the marine basin of Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, we find retrograde slopes along Ninnis and Denman glaciers, with stabilizing slopes beneath Moscow University, Totten and Lambert glacier system, despite corrections in bed elevation of up to 1 km for the latter. This transformative description of bed topography redefines the high- and lower-risk sectors for rapid sea level rise from Antarctica; it will also significantly impact model projections of sea level rise from Antarctica in the coming centuries. A high-resolution update of Antarctic bed topography using mass conservation reveals broad stabilizing ridges for glaciers flowing across the Transantarctic Mountains, and stabilizing slopes beneath Moscow University, Totten and Lambert glacier system.},

	abstract = {Surface melt ponds form intermittently on several Antarctic ice shelves. Although implicated in ice-shelf break up, the consequences of such ponding for ice formation and ice-shelf structure have not been evaluated. Here we report the discovery of a massive subsurface ice layer, at least 16 km across, several kilometres long and tens of metres deep, located in an area of intense melting and intermittent ponding on Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctica. We combine borehole optical televiewer logging and radar measurements with remote sensing and firn modelling to investigate the layer, found to be ∼10 °C warmer and ∼170 kg m−3 denser than anticipated in the absence of ponding and hitherto used in models of ice-shelf fracture and flow. Surface ponding and ice layers such as the one we report are likely to form on a wider range of Antarctic ice shelves in response to climatic warming in forthcoming decades. The influence of surface ponding on the interior of ice shelves is currently unknown. Here, the authors combine surface and borehole geophysics on the Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctica, with remote sensing and modelling and show how pond refreezing increases ice shelf density and temperature.},

This, together with acknowledged impacts on other components of the Earth system, has led to the term “the new Arctic.” Global coupled climate models predict that ice loss will continue through the twenty-first century, with implications for governance, economics, security, and global weather. A wide range in model projections reflects the complex, highly coupled interactions between the polar atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere, including teleconnections to lower latitudes. This paper summarizes our present understanding of how heat reaches the ice base from the original sources—inflows of Atlantic and Pacific Water, river discharge, and summer sensible heat and shortwave radiative fluxes at the ocean/ice surface—and speculates on how such processes may change in the new Arctic.

	abstract = {AbstractThe authors evaluate 23 coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models from phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5) in terms of their ability to simulate the observed climatological mean energy budget of the Antarctic atmosphere. While the models are shown to capture the gross features of the energy budget well [e.g., the observed two-way balance between the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) net radiation and horizontal convergence of atmospheric energy transport], the simulated TOA absorbed shortwave (SW) radiation is too large during austral summer. In the multimodel mean, this excessive absorption reaches approximately 10 W m−2, with even larger biases (up to 25–30 W m−2) in individual models. Previous studies have identified similar climate model biases in the TOA net SW radiation at Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes and have attributed these biases to errors in the simulated cloud cover. Over the Antarctic, though, model cloud errors are of secondary importance, and biases in the simulated TOA net SW flux are inst...},

	abstract = {Human population density in the coastal zone and potential impacts of climate change underscore a growing conflict between coastal development and an encroaching shoreline. Rising sea-levels and increased storminess threaten to accelerate coastal erosion, while growing demand for coastal real estate encourages more spending to hold back the sea in spite of the shrinking federal budget for beach nourishment. As climatic drivers and federal policies for beach nourishment change, the evolution of coastline mitigation and property values is uncertain. We develop an empirically grounded, stochastic dynamic model coupling coastal property markets and shoreline evolution, including beach nourishment, and show that a large share of coastal property value reflects capitalized erosion control. The model is parameterized for coastal properties and physical forcing in North Carolina, U.S.A. and we conduct sensitivity analyses using property values spanning a wide range of sandy coastlines along the U.S. East Coast. The model shows that a sudden removal of federal nourishment subsidies, as has been proposed, could trigger a dramatic downward adjustment in coastal real estate, analogous to the bursting of a bubble. We find that the policy-induced inflation of property value grows with increased erosion from sea level rise or increased storminess, but the effect of background erosion is larger due to human behavioral feedbacks. Our results suggest that if nourishment is not a long-run strategy to manage eroding coastlines, a gradual removal is more likely to smooth the transition to more climate-resilient coastal communities.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02714},
	abstract = {The CTD is a set of sensors used by oceanographers to measure fundamental hydrographic properties of the oceans. It is characterized by a high precision product, only achieved if a quality control procedure identifies and removes the bad samples. Such procedure has been traditionally done by a sequence of independent tests that minimize false negatives. It is here proposed a novel approach to identify the bad samples as anomalies in respect to the typical behavior of good data. Several tests are combined into a single multidimensional evaluation to provide a more flexible classification criterion. The traditional approach is reproduced with an error of 0.04\%, otherwise, the Anomaly Detection technique surpasses the reference if calibrated by visual inspection. CoTeDe is a Python package developed to apply the traditional and the Anomaly Detection quality control of temperature and salinity data from CTD, and can be extended to XBT, ARGO and other sensors.},

The review shows that the GBMD is best characterized as a composite system, with different regions having morphologic and stratigraphic attributes of an upland fluvial fan delta; a lowland, backwater-reach delta; a downdrift tidal delta plain; and an offshore subaqueous-delta clinoform. These distinct areas of upland and lowland fluvial reaches and tidal dominance vary in time and space, and we distinguish late-Holocene phases of delta construction, maintenance, and decline similar to delta-lobe cycling in other systems. The overall stability of the GBMD landform, relative to many deltas, reflects the efficient, widespread dispersal of sediment by the large monsoon discharge and high-energy tides that affect this region. However, we do identify portions of the delta that are in decline and losing elevation relative to sea level owing to i...},

	abstract = {We model the role of katabatic winds in the formation and maintenance of a blue ice area in Scharffenbergbotnen valley, Antarctica, using the finite element code Elmer. The high-horizontal-resolution (50–200 m) numerical simulations of the local wind flow from katabatic wind fronts show high spatial variability in wind-impact patterns and good congruence between places with high near-surface wind speeds and the blue ice area. In addition we perform wind simulations on an altered glacier geometry that resembles the thicker ice cover at the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM). These simulations indicate that the pronounced spatial wind-impact patterns depend on present-day geometry and did not occur during the LGM. This leads to the conclusion that the formation of the inner blue ice area of the Scharffenbergbotnen valley started only after the lowering of the ice surface, i.e. after the LGM. Experiments with smoothed surface topography suggest that detailed positions of the high wind regions, and hence individual blue ice fields, may have varied as the ice sheet lowered. The simulation results obtained with the present-day geometry were fortuitously confirmed by the destruction of a field camp located in a high-wind-speed area and its subsequent redistribution to low-velocity areas. The experiments and the field observations are consistent with localized violent katabatic events rather than synoptic-scale storms, playing the dominant role in the formation and maintenance of this and perhaps many blue ice areas.},

We use sea-surface reflections of GPS signals, recorded as oscillations in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to estimate the GNSS to tide gauge (TG) levelling tie, and thus the ellipsoidal heights of the TG. We develop approaches to isolate SNR data dominated by sea-surface reflections and to remove SNR frequency changes caused by the dynamic sea surface. Comparison with in situ levelling at eight sites reveals mean differences at the centimetre level for satellites above 12

elevation, with four sites showing differences of 3 cm or smaller. These differences include errors in the in situ levelling, in the antenna calibration model and in the TG measurements, and so represent an upper bound on our technique’s error. Data sampling (1 or 30 s) does not significantly affect the results. We detect systematic errors at the decimetre level related to satellite elevations below 12

and to sea-surface height and also differences between results from the L1 and L2 GPS signals larger than 15 cm at two sites. These systematic errors remain unexplained; differences between GPS signals are attributed to receiver-dependent differences in the SNR measurements, while the elevation-dependent error is attributed to unmodelled phase effects such as those caused by tropospheric refraction and sea-surface roughness. Using our approach, we identify a levelling offset of 1.5 cm related to a TG sensor change, illustrating our technique’s value for TG reference monitoring.},

	abstract = {Ocean eddies with diameters of tens to hundreds of kilometers are an important component of water transport on a global scale. Averaged over periods of many years, ocean circulation is regular and coherent enough to have been described as a conveyor belt. However, over shorter time scales, irregular, discrete events cause significant amounts of water movement—termed mesoscale eddies. Zhang et al. combined data from thousands of autonomous observational devices called ARGO floats with satellite data. The mesoscale eddies moved around as much ocean water as wind or deepwater currents.

	doi = {10.1063/1.4848776},
	abstract = {We develop a perturbation theory for a class of first order nonlinear non-autonomous stochastic ordinary differential equations that arise in climate physics. The perturbative procedure produces moments in terms of integral delay equations, whose order by order decay is characterized in a Floquet-like sense. Both additive and multiplicative sources of noise are discussed and the question of how the nature of the noise influences the results is addressed theoretically and numerically. By invoking the Martingale property, we rationalize the transformation of the underlying Stratonovich form of the model to an It o ̂ form, independent of whether the noise is additive or multiplicative. The generality of the analysis is demonstrated by developing it both for a Brownian particle moving in a periodically forced quartic potential, which acts as a simple model of stochastic resonance, as well as for our more complex climate physics model. The validity of the approach is shown by comparison with numerical solutions. The particular climate dynamics problem upon which we focus involves a low-order model for the evolution of Arctic sea ice under the influence of increasing greenhouse gas forcing ΔF 0. The deterministic model, developed by Eisenman and Wettlaufer [“Nonlinear threshold behavior during the loss of Arctic sea ice,” Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.106(1), 28–32 (2009)] exhibits several transitions as ΔF 0 increases and the stochastic analysis is used to understand the manner in which noise influences these transitions and the stability of the system.},

	abstract = {Ocean circulation is a key determinant of climate and climate change; therefore the topic is extremely hot. As a moderator and initiator of climatic variability and change and as an economic resource, the global ocean is vital to life on earth. Quantifying the ocean's role in climate has become a matter of urgency as society attempts to gauge how growing greenhouse gas concentrations will affect climate. The book represents all the knowledge we currently have on ocean circulation. It presents an up-to-date summary of the state of the science relating to the role of the oceans in the physical climate system. The book is structured to guide the reader throught the wide range of World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) science in a consistent way. Cross-references between contributors have been added, and the book contains a comprehensive index and unified reference list.},

	abstract = {Thwaites Glacier is one of the largest, most rapidly changing glaciers on Earth, and its landward-sloping bed reaches the interior of the marine West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which impounds enough ice to yield meters of sea-level rise. Marine ice sheets with landward-sloping beds have a potentially unstable configuration in which acceleration can initiate or modulate grounding-line retreat and ice loss. Subglacial water has been observed and theorized to accelerate the flow of overlying ice dependent on whether it is hydrologically distributed or concentrated. However, the subglacial water systems of Thwaites Glacier and their control on ice flow have not been characterized by geophysical analysis. The only practical means of observing these water systems is airborne ice-penetrating radar, but existing radar analysis approaches cannot discriminate between their dynamically critical states. We use the angular distribution of energy in radar bed echoes to characterize both the extent and hydrologic state of subglacial water systems across Thwaites Glacier. We validate this approach with radar imaging, showing that substantial water volumes are ponding in a system of distributed canals upstream of a bedrock ridge that is breached and bordered by a system of concentrated channels. The transition between these systems occurs with increasing surface slope, melt-water flux, and basal shear stress. This indicates a feedback between the subglacial water system and overlying ice dynamics, which raises the possibility that subglacial water could trigger or facilitate a grounding-line retreat in Thwaites Glacier capable of spreading into the interior of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.},

	abstract = {The last six years (2007–2012) show a persistent change in early summer Arctic wind patterns relative to previous decades. The persistent pattern, which has been previously recognized as the Arctic Dipole (AD), is characterized by relatively low sea-level pressure over the Siberian Arctic with high pressure over the Beaufort Sea, extending across northern North America and over Greenland. Pressure differences peak in June. In a search for a proximate cause for the newly persistent AD pattern, we note that the composite 700 hPa geopotential height field during June 2007–2012 exhibits a positive anomaly only on the North American side of the Arctic, thus creating the enhanced mean meridional flow across the Arctic. Coupled impacts of the new persistent pattern are increased sea ice loss in summer, long-lived positive temperature anomalies and ice sheet loss in west Greenland, and a possible increase in Arctic-subarctic weather linkages through higher-amplitude upper-level flow. The North American location of increased 700 hPa positive anomalies suggests that a regional atmospheric blocking mechanism is responsible for the presence of the AD pattern, consistent with observations of unprecedented high pressure anomalies over Greenland since 2007.},

Advection of this relatively warm water (up to 2°C) across the continental shelf to the base of floating ice shelves is thought to be a critical source of heat for basal melting in some locations. A high-resolution (4 km) regional ocean–sea ice–ice shelf model of the west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) coastal ocean was used to examine the effects of changes in the winds on across-shelf CDW transport and ice shelf basal melt. Increases and decreases in the strength of the wind fields were simulated by scaling the present-day winds by a constant factor. Additional simulations considered effects of increased Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transport. Increased wind strength and ACC transport increased the amount of CDW transported onto the WAP continental shelf but did not necessarily increase CDW flux underneath the nearby ice shelves. The basal melt underneath some of the deeper ice shelves actuall...},

	abstract = {A digital representation of ice surface velocity is essential for a variety of glaciological, geologic and geophysical analyses and modeling. Here, we present a new, reference, comprehensive, high-resolution, digital mosaic of ice motion in Greenland assembled from satellite radar interferometry data acquired during the International Polar Year 2008 to 2009 by the Envisat Advanced Synthetic-Aperture Radar (ASAR), the Advanced Land Observation System (ALOS)'s Phase-Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) and the RADARSAT-1 SAR that covers 99\% of the ice sheet in area. The best mapping performance is obtained using ALOS PALSAR data due to higher levels of temporal coherence at the L-band frequency; but C-band frequency SAR data are less affected by the ionosphere. The ice motion map reveals various flow regimes, ranging from patterned enhanced flow into a few large glaciers in the cold, low precipitation areas of north Greenland; to diffuse, enhanced flow into numerous, narrow, fast-moving glaciers in the warmer, high precipitation sectors of northwest and southeast Greenland. We find that the 100 fastest glaciers (v {\textgreater} 800 m/yr) drain 66\% of the ice sheet in area, marine-terminating glaciers drain 88\% of Greenland, and basal-sliding motion dominates internal deformation over more than 50\% of the ice sheet. This view of ice sheet motion provides significant new constraints on ice flow modeling.},

	abstract = {Ocean currents influence the global heat transport; weather and climate; larval transport; drift of water pollutants; sediment transport; and marine transportation. As a result, oceanographers, coastal managers, and ships need up-to-date information on ocean and coastal currents. Arrays of current meter moorings can measure currents at local scales. Shore-based high-frequency radars are able to map coastal currents over a range of up to 200 km. Ocean drifters can be tracked to obtain circulation patterns over larger areas, but may take months to accomplish it. Only satellite remote sensors can determine currents synoptically over extensive ocean and coastal regions. Satellite altimetry is one of the essential remote-sensing techniques for monitoring dynamic ocean conditions, including surface currents, local wind speed, and significant wave height. Satellite altimetry measures sea surface heights, providing data on geostrophic circulation, including major ocean currents. Ocean currents can also be determined by satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or tracking the movement of thermal and color features in the ocean. The flow patterns of currents like the Gulf Stream are being mapped with satellite infrared scanners. The objective of this paper is to review practical remotesensing techniques for measuring and mapping coastal and ocean currents.},

The 4-km data-constrained solution does not show eddy transport across the Chukchi Shelf at shallow depths; instead, advection of DW downstream of polynya regions is driven by a strong ({\textasciitilde}0.1 m s−1) mean current on the Chukchi Shelf.

	doi = {10.1029/2011GL050486},
	abstract = {An atmospheric general circulation model driven with the observed 2007 extreme Arctic sea surface temperatures and sea ice concentrations responds with higher surface air temperature over northern Siberia and the Eastern Arctic Ocean (+ 3 K), increased heat uptake of the ocean in summer (+ 40 W m(-2)) and increased oceanic heat losses in fall (-60 W m(-2)) compared to a climatological scenario. A pronounced low sea level pressure anomaly over the Eastern Arctic (-200 Pa) reinforces a sea level pressure dipole over the Arctic that has been observed to become an increasingly important feature of the Arctic atmospheric circulation in summer. The anomalous pressure distribution contributes to sea ice transport from the Eastern Arctic and is likely to reinforce the original sea ice extent anomaly. The results thus support assessments of observational data over recent years that sea ice loss may feed back onto the atmospheric circulation in the northern hemisphere. The resulting late summer / early fall (JAS) atmospheric anomalies are very robust, they appear in virtually all of the 40 realizations of the experiment. However, we find no significant continuation of the atmospheric signal into the winter as has been suggested based on atmospheric observational data. Citation: Bluthgen, J., R. Gerdes, and M.

	abstract = {The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to explore the sensitivity of the large-scale atmospheric energy and moisture budgets to prescribed changes in Arctic sea ice and sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Observed sea ice fractions and SSTs from 1996 and 2007, representing years of high and low sea ice extent, are used as lower boundary conditions. A pan-Arctic domain extending into the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is used. ERA-Interim reanalysis data from 1994 to 2008 are employed as initial and lateral forcing data for each high and low sea ice simulation. The addition of a third ensemble, with a mixed SST field between years 1996 and 2007 (using 2007 SSTs above 66 degrees N and 1996 values below), results in a total of three 15-member ensembles. Results of the simulations show both local and remote responses to reduced sea ice. The local polar cap averaged response is largest in October and November, dominated by increased turbulent heat fluxes resulting in vertically deep heating and moistening of the Arctic atmosphere. This warmer and moister atmosphere is associated with an increase in cloud cover, affecting the surface and atmospheric energy budgets. There is an enhancement of the hydrologic cycle, with increased evaporation in areas of sea ice loss paired with increased precipitation. Most of the Arctic climate response results from within-Arctic changes, although some changes in the hydrologic cycle reflect circulation responses to midlatitude SST forcing, highlighting the general sensitivity of the Arctic climate.},

We demonstrate good agreement between SMB annual series constructed from 20CR and ECMWF reanalyses for the common period of overlap and show statistically significant agreement of long-term modeled snowfall with ice-core-based accumulation data. We analyze variations in SMB for the last 140 years and highlight the periods with significantly increased runoff and decreased SMB since 1870, which have both been enhanced in the period since 1990, as well as interannual variations in SMB linked to Greenland climate fluctuations. We show very good agreement of our SMB series variations with existing, independently derived SMB series (RACMO2) variations for the past few decades of overlap but also a significant disparity of up to ∼200 km3 yr−1 in absolute SMB values due to poorly constrained modeled accumulation reflecting a lack of adequate validation data in southeast Greenland. There is no significant correlation between our SMB time series and a widely referenced time series of North Atlantic icebergs emanating from Greenland for the past century, which may reflect the complex nature of the relationship between SMB and ice dynamical changes. Finally, we discuss how our analysis sheds light on the sensitivity and response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to ongoing and future global climate change, and its contribution to global sea level rise.},

The total heat loss is 198 TW and the freshwater gain 52 mSv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1), with residuals equal to 1 TW and 3 mSv, respectively. Budgets are also computed for three subregions within the Nordic seas: the Norwegian Sea, the Barents Sea and the Greenland/Iceland Sea. Without accounting for transfer of heat and freshwater across the Arctic Front, which separates the Greenland/Iceland Sea from the Norwegian Sea, the residuals of the heat and freshwater budgets range from −36 TW to 34 TW and from −16 mSv to 19 mSv, respectively. To close the budgets of all subregions cross-frontal fluxes of −35 TW and 17 mSv, caused either by eddy shedding along the Arctic Front or ocean currents not accounted for, must be included. Combined with observations of the average temperature and salinity on both sides of the Arctic Front these values indicate a rate of cross-frontal water exchange of approximately 4 Sv. The most intense water mass modifications occur in the Norwegian Sea, where ocean heat loss and freshwater input are equal to 119 TW and 41 mSv, respectively.},

	abstract = {We use hydrological and current meter data collected in the Ross Sea, Antarctica between 1995 and 2006 to describe the spatial and temporal variability of water masses involved in the production of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). Data were collected in two regions of known outflows of dense shelf water in this region; the Drygalski Trough (DT) and the Glomar-Challenger Trough (GCT). Dense shelf water just inshore of the shelf break is dominated by High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) in the DT and Ice Shelf Water (ISW) in the GCT. The HSSW in the northern DT freshened by ˜0.06 in 11 y, while the ISW in the northern GCT freshened by ˜0.04 in 8 y and warmed by ˜0.04 °C in 11 y, dominated by a rapid warming during austral summer 2001/02. The Antarctic Slope Front separating the warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) from the shelf waters is more stable near GCT than near DT, with CDW and mixing products being found on the outer DT shelf but not on the outer GCT shelf. The different source waters and mixing processes at the two sites lead to production of AABW with different thermohaline characteristics in the central and western Ross Sea. Multi-year time series of hydrography and currents at long-term moorings within 100 km of the shelf break in both troughs confirm the interannual signals in the dense shelf water and reveal the seasonal cycle of water mass properties. Near the DT the HSSW salinities experienced maxima in March/April and minima in September/October. The ISW in the GCT is warmest in March/April and coolest between August and October. Mooring data also demonstrate significant high-frequency variability associated with tides and other processes. Wavelet analysis of near-bottom moored sensors sampling the dense water cascade over the continental slope west of the GCT shows intermittent energetic pulses of cold, dense water with periods from ˜32 h to ˜5 days.},

AWS wind data revealed a strong tendency toward downslope flow in the region regardless of season, as the majority (55\%) of winds were from the west to northwesterly directions. Most winds observed at the site were less than 20 m s−1, but 83\% of the stronger winds were associated with downslope flow. Of 15 strong wind events (greater than 20 m s−1 for more than 10 h) evaluated during the cyclone analysis period, 100\% occurred in the presence of a cyclone in the adjacent Ross Sea. Winter experienced the greatest number of strong wind events (68\%), and summer had the least (4\%). Most te...},

Collectively, during this decade, the 39 glaciers lost a cumulative area of 1368 km2. More than three-quarters of the total area change occurred north of 72 degrees N. The largest 11-year area change for a single glacier during the survey period is the 311 km(2) loss. at Humboldt Glacier. The largest annual change for a single glacier was extreme compared with the others, where Petermann glacier retreated 17 km between 3 and 5 August 2010. For the 10 year sample, on average, the count of glaciers retreating is twice that advancing. A larger distinction is evident considering area change, with the ratio of retreat and advance, on average, nine times the gain. For glaciers with ice shelves, we find no year with collective area gain. The area change data from this study are posted at: http://bprc.osu.edu/similar to jbox/data/GAC/},

	abstract = {The global increase in atmospheric CO2 since the preindustrial era has not been accompanied by a long-term trend in the (COO)-O-18/CO2 ratio (denoted as delta C-a), though many monitoring stations around the world observed a downward excursion in delta C-a (of about 0.1 parts per thousand y(-1)) after 1992/1993 that lasted for 5-6 years. A number of studies have suggested that the interannual variation, seasonal cycle, and spatial structure of delta C-a depend on terrestrial ecosystem fluxes. The delta C-a budget is evaluated to identify meteorological variables that could potentially influence the observed interannual delta C-a variations. Using global data sets, time series of relative humidity, O-18 composition of precipitation (delta W-P), air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation were correlated with Mauna Loa delta C-a variations. Observed delta C-a negatively correlated with relative humidity in tropical and middle- and high-latitude regions, and we estimated that observed relative humidity variations drove a 0.14 parts per thousand decrease in delta C-a during the mid-1990s. Similar variations in precipitation rates were also found within the tropics that suggest positive correlations between delta W-P and delta C-a consistent with an amount effect (delta W-P decreases as precipitation increases). The decrease in delta W-P during the 1990s was estimated to decrease delta C-a by as much as 0.48 parts per thousand. In contrast to previous work, little evidence was found that would suggest carbon flux anomalies as the primary driver of interannual delta C-a variations. We conclude that interannual delta C-a variations were driven primarily by isotope hydrology and relative humidity, and that delta C-a can be exploited as a new constraint on hydrological cycle variations at a variety of scales.},

This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF. Copyright (C) 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {The planetary albedo is partitioned into a component due to atmospheric reflection and a component due to surface reflection by using shortwave fluxes at the surface and top of the atmosphere in conjunction with a simple radiation model. The vast majority of the observed global average planetary albedo (88\%) is due to atmospheric reflection. Surface reflection makes a relatively small contribution to planetary albedo because the atmosphere attenuates the surface contribution to planetary albedo by a factor of approximately 3. The global average planetary albedo in the ensemble average of phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) preindustrial simulations is also primarily (87\%) due to atmospheric albedo. The intermodel spread in planetary albedo is relatively large and is found to be predominantly a consequence of intermodel differences in atmospheric albedo, with surface processes playing a much smaller role despite significant intermodel differences in surface albedo. The CMIP3 models show a decrease in planetary albedo under a doubling of carbon dioxide-also primarily due to changes in atmospheric reflection (which explains more than 90\% of the intermodel spread). All models show a decrease in planetary albedo due to the lowered surface albedo associated with a contraction of the cryosphere in a warmer world, but this effect is small compared to the spread in planetary albedo due to model differences in the change in clouds.},

	abstract = {During summer 2007 the Arctic sea-ice shrank to the lowest extent ever observed. The role of the atmospheric energy transport in this extreme melt event is explored using the state-of-the-art ERA-Interim reanalysis data. We find that in summer 2007 there was an anomalous atmospheric flow of warm and humid air into the region that suffered severe melt. This anomaly was larger than during any other year in the data (1989-2008). Convergence of the atmospheric energy transport over this area led to positive anomalies of the downward longwave radiation and turbulent fluxes. In the region that experienced unusual ice melt, the net anomaly of the surface fluxes provided enough extra energy to melt roughly one meter of ice during the melting season. When the ocean successively became ice-free, the surface-albedo decreased causing additional absorption of shortwave radiation, despite the fact that the downwelling solar radiation was smaller than average. We argue that the positive anomalies of net downward longwave radiation and turbulent fluxes played a key role in initiating the 2007 extreme ice melt, whereas the shortwave-radiation changes acted as an amplifying feedback mechanism in response to the melt.},

	abstract = {A version of the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) has been developed for use in polar climates. The model known as "Polar WRF" is tested for land areas with a western Arctic grid that has 25-km resolution. This work serves as preparation for the high-resolution Arctic System Reanalysis of the years 2000-10. The model is based upon WRF version 3.0.1.1, with improvements to the Noah land surface model and snow/ice treatment. Simulations consist of a series of 48-h integrations initialized daily at 0000 UTC, with the initial 24 h taken as spinup for atmospheric hydrology and boundary layer processes. Soil temperature and moisture that have a much slower spinup than the atmosphere are cycled from 48-h output of earlier runs. Arctic conditions are simulated for a winter-to-summer seasonal cycle from 15 November 2006 to 1 August 2007. Simulation results are compared with a variety of observations from several Alaskan sites, with emphasis on the North Slope. Polar WRF simulation results show good agreement with most near-surface observations. Warm temperature biases are found for winter and summer. A sensitivity experiment with reduced soil heat conductivity, however, improves simulation of near-surface temperature, ground heat flux, and soil temperature during winter. There is a marked deficit in summer cloud cover over land with excessive incident shortwave radiation. The cloud deficit may result from anomalous vertical mixing of moisture by the turbulence parameterization. The new snow albedo parameterization for WRF 3.1.1 is successfully tested for snowmelt over the North Slope of Alaska.},

In 21st century projections, models with large Arctic amplification have strong surface albedo and longwave cloud feedbacks, but only weak increases (or even decreases) in total energy transport into the Arctic. Enhanced Arctic warming weakens the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and decreases atmospheric dry static energy transport, a decrease that often outweighs increases from atmospheric moisture transport and ocean heat transport. Model spread in atmospheric energy transport cannot explain model spread in polar amplification; models with greater polar amplification must instead have stronger local feedbacks. Because local feedbacks affect temperature gradients, coupling between energy transports and Arctic feedbacks cannot be neglected when studying Arctic amplification. Citation: Hwang, Y.-T., D. M. W.

	abstract = {Increased sea ice melt and decreased surface albedo have changed the near-surface water mass structure of the Canada Basin. From 1993-2009, the near-surface temperature maximum (NSTM) and remnant of the previous winter's mixed layer (rWML) warmed by about 1.5 degrees C and 0.5 degrees C and freshened by about 4 and 2 practical salinity units, respectively. Results from a 1-D model suggest rWML warming can be explained by heat diffusion from both the NSTM and Pacific Summer Water (PSW). The same model predicts salinization of the rWML, whereas freshening was observed. This suggests that changes to the rWML are from both diffusion and the accumulation of freshwater. The rWML's salinity was associated with distance from the center of the Beaufort Gyre; the rWML at stations inside the gyre was on average 1.9 salinity units fresher than at stations outside. In addition, the salinity of PSW in the Canada Basin - defined by its local temperature maximum - freshened from about 30-32 in 1993 to 28-32 in 2008. Order of magnitude calculations suggest that neither changes in PSW source waters nor changes in advection pathways of PSW explain this freshening. Our model suggests that salt diffused from PSW to the freshening rWML; this diffusion increased (and freshened the PSW salinity range) as the rWML freshened. These results show that surface effects through warming and ice melt are felt to at least the depth of PSW. Observations from 2009 show the appearance of a third temperature maximum from an as yet unknown source.},

Monthly mean simulated surface skin temperature, radiative fluxes and cloud parameters are evaluated using retrievals from the extended AVHHR Polar Pathfinder (APP-x) product. We analyzed the annual cycle but the main focus is on the winter, in which large parts of the region experience polar night. We find a smaller across-model spread as well as better agreement with observations during summer than during winter in the simulated climatological annual cycles of total cloudiness and surface skin temperature. The across-model spread in liquid and ice water paths is substantial during the whole year. These results qualitatively agree with earlier studies on the present-day Arctic climate in GCMs. The climatological ensemble model mean annual cycle of surface cloud forcing shows good agreement with observations in summer. However, during winter the insulating effect of clouds tends to be underestimated in models. During winter, most of the models as well as the observations show higher monthly mean total cloud fractions, associated with larger positive surface cloud forcing. Most models also show good correlation between the surface cloud forcing and the vertically integrated ice and liquid cloud condensate. The wintertime ensemble model mean total cloud fraction (69\%) shows excellent agreement with observations. The across-model spread in the winter mean cloudiness is substantial (36-94\%) however and several models significantly underestimate the cloud liquid water content. If the two models not showing any relationship between cloudiness and surface cloud forcing are disregarded, a tentative across-model relation exists, in such a way that models that simulate large winter mean cloudiness also show larger surface cloud forcing. Even though the across-model spread in wintertime surface cloud forcing is large, no clear relation to the surface temperature is found. This indicates that other processes, not explicitly cloud related, are important for the simulated across-model spread in surface temperature.},

Modeled late 20th century ice extent loss also cannot be explained by natural causes alone, but the six available CCSM4 ensemble members exhibit a large spread in their late 20th century ice extent loss. Comparing trends from the CCSM4 ensemble to observed trends suggests that internal variability explains approximately half of the observed 1979-2005 September Arctic sea ice extent loss. In a warming world, CCSM4 shows that multi-decadal negative trends increase in frequency and magnitude, and that trend variability on 2-10 year timescales increases.

While near-surface temperature and humidity are minimally affected by sea ice loss in July 2007 forecasts, near-surface stability decreases and atmospheric humidity increases aloft over newly open water in September 2007 forecasts. Ubiquitous low cloud increases over the newly ice-free Arctic Ocean are found in both the July 2007 and the September 2007 forecasts. In response to the 2007 sea ice loss, net surface [top of the atmosphere (TOA)] energy budgets change by +19.4 W m(-2) (+21.0 W m(-2)) and -17.9 W m(-2) (+1.4 W m(-2)) in the July 2007 and September 2007 forecasts, respectively. While many aspects of the forecasted response to sea ice loss are consistent with physical expectations and available observations, CAM4's ubiquitous July 2007 cloud increases over newly open water are not. The unrealistic cloud response results from the global application of parameterization designed to diagnose stratus clouds based on lower-tropospheric stability (CLDST). In the Arctic, the well-mixed boundary layer assumption implicit in CLDST is violated. Requiring a well-mixed boundary layer to diagnose stratus clouds improves the CAM4 cloud response to sea ice loss and increases July 2007 surface (TOA) energy budgets over newly open water by +11 W m(-2) (+14.9 W m(-2)). Of importance to high-latitude climate feedbacks, unrealistic stratus cloud compensation for sea ice loss occurs only when stable and dry atmospheric conditions exist. Therefore, coupled climate projections that use CAM4 will underpredict Arctic sea ice loss only when dry and stable summer conditions occur.},

Validation against tower observations and radiosoundings showed fairly good agreement, although a systematic warm and moist bias and slightly overestimated wind speeds were found close to the surface. The spatial variability within a fjord was large and it often reached levels comparable to the temporal variability. The spatial variability of the surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat was mostly controlled by the air and sea surface temperatures instead of wind speed. The same cases were also simulated without any topography over Svalbard. The topography increased the spatial variability but the influence on the mean values was not systematic, except that a clear warming effect was seen in all the fjords studied. The role of surface type increased with increasing air-sea temperature difference and was dominating over topographic effects for the air temperature, specific humidity and turbulent heat fluxes.},

The results showed that the literature-based universal functions underestimated turbulent mixing in strongly stable conditions. The validity of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory was questionable for cross-fjord flow directions and in the presence of mesoscale variability or topographic effects. The aerodynamic roughness length showed a dependence on the wind direction. The mean roughness length for along-fjord wind directions was (2.4 +/- 2.6) x 10(-4) m, whereas that for cross-fjord directions was (5.4 +/- 2.8) x 10(-3) m. The thermal stratification and turbulent fluxes were affected by the synoptic situation with large differences between the 2 years. Channelling effects and drainage flows occurred especially during a weak large-scale flow. The study periods were simulated applying the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with 1-km horizontal resolution in the finest domain. The results for the 2-m air temperature and friction velocity were good, but the model failed to reproduce the spatial variability in wind direction between measurement sites 3 km apart. The model suggested that wind shear above the stable boundary layer provided a non-local source for the turbulence observed.},

	abstract = {The temperature of the surface atmosphere over land has been rising during recent decades. But surface temperature, or, more accurately, enthalpy which can be calculated from temperature, is only one component of the energy content of the surface atmosphere. The other parts include kinetic energy and latent heat. It has been advocated in certain quarters that ignoring additional terms somehow calls into question global surface temperature analyses. Examination of all three of these components of atmospheric energetics reveals a significant increase in global surface atmospheric energy since the 1970s. Kinetic energy has decreased but by over two orders of magnitude less than the increases in both enthalpy and latent heat which provide approximately equal contributions to the global increases in heat content. Regionally, the enthalpy or the latent heat component can dominate the change in heat content. Although generally changes in latent heat and enthalpy act in concert, in some regions they can have the opposite signs. Citation: Peterson, T. C., K. M. Willett, and P. W.

	abstract = {We have developed an automatic method to identify changes in the position of calving glacier margins using daily MODIS imagery. Application of the method to 32 ocean-terminating glaciers in East Greenland produced 26,802 margin positions for a 10 year long period (2000-2009). We report these high-resolution data and show that the glaciers exhibit seasonal cycles with magnitudes of advance and retreat proportional to glacier width. Despite similar seasonality there is a distinct difference between the interannual trends of calving front positions north and south of 69 degrees N. All glaciers above this latitude showed very limited or no change when seasonality was excluded, while glaciers south of 69 degrees N retreated significantly between 2001 and 2005 (similar to 2.3 km on average). Approximately 26\% of the retreat of southern glaciers was regained by readvance from 2005 to 2009. To explain the latitudinal boundary of glacier dynamics, we review basic climatic factors, including summer and winter atmospheric forcing, sea ice conditions, and ocean temperature. We conclude that the southern retreats were strongly influenced by warm oceanic conditions associated with increased transport of subtropical waters to the Irminger Sea and to fjords and coastal regions south of 69 degrees N. Northern glaciers remained stable despite significant increase in runoff in this region because fjords at latitudes higher than 69 degrees N are less exposed to subtropical waters. The southern retreats illustrate sensitive behavior of calving glaciers, and we hypothesize that the calving fronts retreated because they were exposed to rapid ice-front melting.},

Although the major transport challenges related to climate warming are understood, so far there have been no quantitative projections of Arctic transport system change. Here we present a new modelling framework to quantify changing access to oceans and landscapes northward of 40 degrees N by mid-century. The analysis integrates climate and sea-ice model scenarios(1,2) with topography, hydrography, land cover, transportation infrastructure and human settlements. Declining sea-ice concentration and thickness suggest faster travel and improved access to existing (+5 to +28\%) and theoretical (+11 to +37\%) offshore exclusive economic zones of Canada, Greenland, Russia and the US. The Northern Sea Route, Arctic Bridge and North Pole routes are projected to become fully accessible from July-September, averaging similar to 11, 15 and 16 days to traverse, respectively, whereas the Northwest Passage will not. All eight Arctic states are projected to suffer steep declines (-11 to -82\%) in accessibility inland, driven by lost potential for winter road construction caused by milder winters and deeper snow accumulation.},

	abstract = {The variance of the North Atlantic Oscillation index (denoted N) is shown to depend on its coupling with area-averaged sea ice concentration anomalies in and around the Barents Sea (index denoted B). The observed form of this coupling is a negative feedback whereby positive N tends to produce negative B, which in turn forces negative N. The effects of this feedback in the system are examined by modifying the feedback in two modeling frameworks: a statistical vector autoregressive model (F (VAR)) and an atmospheric global climate model (F (CAM)) customized so that sea ice anomalies on the lower boundary are stochastic with adjustable sensitivity to the model's evolving N. Experiments show that the variance of N decreases nearly linearly with the sensitivity of B to N, where the sensitivity is a measure of the negative feedback strength. Given that the sea ice concentration field has anomalies, the variance of N goes down as these anomalies become more sensitive to N. If the sea ice concentration anomalies are entirely absent, the variance of N is even smaller than the experiment with the most sensitive anomalies. Quantifying how the variance of N depends on the presence and sensitivity of sea ice anomalies to N has implications for the simulation of N in global climate models. In the physical system, projected changes in sea ice thickness or extent could alter the sensitivity of B to N, impacting the within-season variability and hence predictability of N.},

A prominent ridge with two distinct peaks has been identified 40 km in front of the present-day grounding line, undulating between 300-700 m below sea level with an average relief of 700 m. Presently, the Thwaites ice shelf is pinned on the eastern peak. More extensive pinning in the past would have restricted flow of floating ice across the full width of the Thwaites Glacier system. At present thinning rates, ice would have lost contact with the western part of the ridge between 55-150 years ago, allowing unconfined flow of floating ice and contributing to the present-day mass imbalance of Thwaites Glacier. The bathymetric model also reveals a 1200 m deep trough beneath a bight in the grounding line where the glacier is moving the fastest. This newly defined trough marks the lowest topographic pathway to the Byrd Subglacial Basin, and the most likely path for future grounding line retreat. Citation: Tinto, K. J., and R. E.

	abstract = {We investigate the behavior of clouds during rapid sea ice loss events (RILEs) in the Arctic, as simulated by multiple ensemble projections of the 21st century in the Community Climate System Model (CCSM3). Trends in cloud properties and sea ice coverage during RILEs are compared with their secular trends between 2000 and 2049 during summer, autumn, and winter. The results suggest that clouds promote abrupt Arctic climate change during RILEs through increased (decreased) cloudiness in autumn (summer) relative to the changes over the first half of the 21st century. The trends in cloud characteristics (cloud amount, water content, and radiative forcing) during RILEs are most strongly and consistently an amplifying effect during autumn, the season in which RILEs account for the majority of the secular trends. The total cloud trends in every season are primarily due to low clouds, which show a more robust response than middle and high clouds across RILEs. Lead-lag correlations of monthly sea ice concentration and cloud cover during autumn reveal that the relationship between less ice and more clouds is enhanced during RILEs, but there is no evidence that either variable is leading the other. Given that Arctic cloud projections in CCSM3 are similar to those from other state-of-the-art GCMs and that observations show increased autumn cloudiness associated with the extreme 2007 and 2008 sea ice minima, this study suggests that the rapidly declining Arctic sea ice will be accentuated by changes in polar clouds.},

Strong inversions were deep with a highly elevated base, and the strongest ones occurred in warm air mass. Unexpectedly, downward longwave radiation measured at the sounding site did not correlate with the inversion properties. Temperature inversions had lower base and top heights than humidity inversions, the former due to surface cooling and the latter due to adiabatic cooling with height. Most low-level jets were related to katabatic winds. Over the ice-covered Kongsfjorden, jets were lifted above a cold-air pool on the fjord; the jet core was located highest when the snow surface was coldest.

The major teleconnection patterns of the Northern Hemisphere, El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) were of moderate to strong amplitude, making both potentially key players during the winter of 2009–2010. The dominant NH winter circulation pattern can be shown to have originated with a two-way stratosphere-troposphere interaction forced by Eurasian land surface and lower tropospheric atmospheric conditions during autumn. This cycle occurred twice in relatively quick succession contributing to the record low values of the AO observed. Using a skillful winter temperature forecast, it is shown that the AO explained a greater variance of the observed temperature pattern across the extratropical landmasses of the NH than did ENSO.},

We here offer a comprehensive hypothesis of how Earth emerged from the last global ice age. A prerequisite was the growth of very large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, whose subsequent collapse created stadial conditions that disrupted global patterns of ocean and atmospheric circulation. The Southern Hemisphere westerlies shifted poleward during each northern stadial, producing pulses of ocean upwelling and warming that together accounted for much of the termination in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. Rising atmospheric CO₂ during southern upwelling pulses augmented warming during the last termination in both polar hemispheres.},

Data used include Argo float profiles, CTD synoptic sections, Southern Elephant Seals as Oceanographic Samplers (SEaOS) instrument-mounted seal profiles, XBTs, altimetric observations [Envisat, Geosat, Jason-1, and Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon], and infrared and microwave radiometer observed sea surface temperature. An adjoint model is used to determine descent directions in minimizing a misfit function, each of whose elements has been weighted by an estimate of the observational plus model error. The model is brought into near agreement with the data by adjusting its control vector, here consisting of initial and meteorological boundary conditions. Although total consistency has not yet been achieved, the existing solution is in good agreement with the great majority of the 2005 and 2006 Southern Ocean observations and better repr...},

The models that make up the three-model ensemble (CCCMA-CGCM3.1(T63), MIROC3.2(hires), and MPI-ECHAM5), which are all atmosphere-ocean global circulation models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report, were chosen due to their ability to best reproduce North Atlantic surface synoptic climatology and Greenland precipitation from ERA-40. Daily sea level pressure and precipitation data from model simulations for years 1961–1999, 2046–2065, and 2081–2100 are compared, where future simulations are based on the SRES A1B emissions scenario. Results indicate that the North Atlantic storm track is predicted to shift northward through the 21st century and Greenland precipitation is predicted to increase from 35.8 cm yr−1 to 45.8 cm yr−1 by the end of the 21st century, a 27.8\% increase. The precipitation change is attributed to changes in atmospheric circulation, which are due to changes in synoptic pattern frequency of occurrence, and changes in the amount of precipitation that occurs when a given synoptic circulation pattern occurs, termed intrapattern variability, during the future time periods. The northward shift in storm track results in less precipitation being produced dynamically over the southeast coast of Greenland, but an increase in precipitation over the remainder of the ice sheet, with largest increases over the southwest coast of Greenland and the eastern region. Intrapattern variability changes, however, dominate the future precipitation changes, accounting for 82.5\% of the total change. This is due to an increase in precipitable water in the atmosphere in response to rising temperatures. Changes in sea ice and ocean temperature are also thought to contribute to this change.},

The array was centered on the first quasi-stationary meander crest and trough east of Japan, which is also the region of highest eddy kinetic energy. KESS was the first experiment to deploy a large quantity of these new CPIES instruments, and it was unique in that the instruments were deployed in water depths (5300–6400 m) close to their limit of operation. A comprehensive narrative of the methodology to produce mesoscale-resolving four-dimensional circulation fields of temperature, specific volume anomaly, and velocity from the KESS CPIES array is provided.

Alors que l'adaptation est une réponse réactive au changement climatique, recentrer l'attention sur l'anticipation nous permet de voir l'importance de l'intentionnalité, l'action, l'agence, l'imagination, la possibilité et le choix. L'anticipation est également liée au doute, à l'incertitude, la crainte et l'appréhension. À travers à une discussion spécifique sur la chasse, je soutiens que la compréhension des perceptions locales, des préoccupations, de la préparation et des réponses aux changements dans l'environnement dépend de celle du contexte social et culturel de l'anticipation, de comment les gens apprennent à anticiper, et de la nature de cette anticipation. Drawing and reflecting on long-term research and fieldwork in Greenland, I seek through this article to broaden the discussion of adaptation, vulnerability, and resilience in the climate change literature to include a focus on anticipation. While adaptation is a reactive response to climate change, anticipation is more about intentionality, action, agency, imagination, possibility, and choice. It is also about being doubtful, unsure, uncertain, fearful, and apprehensive. Through a specific discussion of hunting, I argue that understanding local perceptions, concerns, preparedness and responses to changes in the environment depends on understanding the social and cultural context of anticipation, how people learn to anticipate, and the nature of that anticipation., LES INUIT ET LE CHANGEMENT CLIMATIQUE / THE INUIT AND CLIMATE CHANGE},

The impact is similar for the two consecutive years, and it is consistent with the observed atmospheric anomalies. Results also show that the impact of the ice is strongly dependent on the underlying sea surface temperature. Results from partial coupling experiments indicate that the sea surface temperature over the Northwest Atlantic strongly affects the mean state of atmospheric circulation over the Euro-Atlantic sector (first-order impact), and conditions the response of the atmosphere to a given ice anomaly (second-order impact).

This study first evaluates the importance of parameterizing the thermal roughness length (z(0h)) to model the surface temperature (T-sfc) and turbulent sensible heat flux (H) in arid regions. Six schemes for z(0h) are implemented into the Noah LSM, revealing the high sensitivity of the simulations to its parameterization. Comparisons are then performed between the original Noah LSM and a revised version with a novel z(0h) scheme against observations at four arid or semiarid sites, including one in Arizona and three in western China. The land they cover is sparse grass or bare soil. The results indicate that the original Noah LSM significantly underestimates T-sfc and overestimates H in the daytime, whereas the revised model can simulate well both T-sfc and H simultaneously. The improved version benefits from the successful modeling of the diurnal variation of z(0h), which the original model cannot produce.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic comparisons and evaluations of the global atmospheric energy and water budgets have been carried out with the new ERA-Interim reanalysis product and with satellite-derived fluxes. In the first part of this paper, we address time discretization, mass imbalance, and spin-up effects, which affect diagnostics from analysis and forecast fields in reanalysis. We discuss two ways of calculating vertically integrated horizontal energy and moisture flux divergence: (1) direct computation using analyzed fields and (2) indirectly from forecast model fluxes and vertically integrated tendencies. The spatial divergence patterns from the indirect method are found to be more realistic than those from direct computation from 6-hourly analyses since they are much less affected by temporal sampling errors, but corrections were nevertheless necessary to ensure mass consistency. The second part of this paper is focused on the interannual variability of ERA-Interim vertical fluxes and on comparisons with satellite flux data. Time series of vertically integrated energy/moisture tendencies and the corresponding analysis increments are also investigated, since shifts in these important quantities indicate artificial jumps in ERA-Interim, and relationships with vertical fluxes indicate internal consistency of the budgets. All data agree in that the most prominent changes in global budgets are internally forced (El Nino-Southern Oscillation). Broad agreement is found in ERA-Interim and Hamburg ocean atmosphere parameters and fluxes from satellite data (HOAPS-3) on a trend in the surface turbulent energy fluxes. Some of this trend may be caused by artificial shifts in ERA-Interim and especially HOAPS-3 in 1992 and possibly 2007. A strong increase in tropical land precipitation during the past decade is found in ERA-Interim and Global Precipitation Climatology Project 2. While large improvements have been made in terms of temporal homogeneity compared with ERA-40, especially with regard to precipitation, the homogeneity issue still needs to be carefully addressed when interpreting surface flux data from reanalyses or other sources.},

	abstract = {For the first time, trends of five climate change indices related to extreme precipitation events in the Hawaiian Islands are investigated using daily observational records from the 1950s to 2007. Four indices [simple daily intensity index (SDII), total number of day with precipitation {\textgreater}= 25.4 mm (R25), annual maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation amount (R5d), and the fraction of annual total precipitation from events exceeding the 1961-90 95th percentile (R95p)] describe the intensity (SDII), frequency (R25), and magnitude (R5d and R95p) of precipitation extremes, and the fifth index [consecutive dry days (CDD)] describes drought conditions. The annual probability density functions (PDFs) of precipitation indices for two epochs (i.e., 1950-79 and 1980-2007) are analyzed. Since the 1980s, there has been a change in the types of precipitation intensity, resulting in more frequent light precipitation and less frequent moderate and heavy precipitation intensity. The other three precipitation-related indices (R25, R5d, and R95p) demonstrate a shift toward the left of the distribution over time, suggesting shorter annual number of days with intense precipitation and smaller consecutive 5-day precipitation amounts and smaller fraction of annual precipitation due to events exceeding the 1961-90 95th percentile in the recent epoch relative to the first epoch. The changes of PDF distribution for SDII, R25, R5d, and CDD are significant at the 5\% level according to a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.A nonparametric trend analysis is then performed for four periods, with different starting years (e. g., the 1950s, the 1960s) but the same ending year (2007). Long-term downward trends are evident for four precipitation-related indices, and long-term upward trends are observed for CDD. Geographically, Kauai and Oahu are dominated by long-term decreasing trends for four precipitation-related indices, while increasing trends play the major role over the island of Hawaii. The upward trends of drought conditions in the long run are predominant on all the major Hawaiian Islands.To investigate whether the trends are stable throughout the time, the derivatives of trends for each of the 30-yr running series are calculated (e.g., 1950-79, 1951-80, ... , 1978-2007) for four precipitation-related indices at each station. For Kauai and Oahu, positive derivatives prevail for all indices in the presence of long-term negative trends, suggestive of a phase change in precipitation extremes and such extremes showing an upswing recently. For the island of Hawaii, there is also an indication of phase reversal over the last 60 yr, with negative derivatives occurring in the presence of the background positive trends.A positive relationship is found between the precipitation indices and the Southern Oscillation index (SOI), implying more precipitation extremes during La Nina years and vice versa for El Nino years. Spatial patterns of standardized anomalies of indices are presented for the La Nina/-PDO minus El Nino/+PDO composites.},

	abstract = {The authors investigate the atmospheric response to projected Arctic sea ice loss at the end of the twenty-first century using an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) coupled to a land surface model. The response was obtained from two 60-yr integrations: one with a repeating seasonal cycle of specified sea ice conditions for the late twentieth century (1980-99) and one with that of sea ice conditions for the late twenty-first century (2080-99). In both integrations, a repeating seasonal cycle of SSTs for 1980-99 was prescribed to isolate the impact of projected future sea ice loss. Note that greenhouse gas concentrations remained fixed at 1980-99 levels in both sets of experiments. The twentieth-and twenty-first-century sea ice (and SST) conditions were obtained from ensemble mean integrations of a coupled GCM under historical forcing and Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario forcing, respectively.The loss of Arctic sea ice is greatest in summer and fall, yet the response of the net surface energy budget over the Arctic Ocean is largest in winter. Air temperature and precipitation responses also maximize in winter, both over the Arctic Ocean and over the adjacent high-latitude continents. Snow depths increase over Siberia and northern Canada because of the enhanced winter precipitation. Atmospheric warming over the high-latitude continents is mainly confined to the boundary layer (below similar to 850 hPa) and to regions with a strong low-level temperature inversion. Enhanced warm air advection by submonthly transient motions is the primary mechanism for the terrestrial warming. A significant large-scale atmospheric circulation response is found during winter, with a baroclinic (equivalent barotropic) vertical structure over the Arctic in November-December (January-March). This response resembles the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation in February only. Comparison with the fully coupled model reveals that Arctic sea ice loss accounts for most of the seasonal, spatial, and vertical structure of the high-latitude warming response to greenhouse gas forcing at the end of the twenty-first century.},

	abstract = {Building on recent observational evidence showing disproportionate increases in temperature and aridity over land in a warming climate, this study examines simulated land-ocean contrasts in fully coupled projections from the Third Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) archive. In addition to the projection of disproportionate changes in temperature and moisture over land, the analysis reveals contrasts in clouds and radiative fluxes that play a key role in the eventual equilibration of the planetary energy budget in response to forcing. Despite differences in magnitude, the nature of the feedbacks governing the land-ocean contrast are largely robust across models, notwithstanding the large intermodel differences in cloud parameterizations, and suggest the involvement of fundamental constraints. The model responses are consistent with previously proposed ideas maintaining that relative humidity (RH) over land decreases with warming because precipitation and the hydrological cycle are governed primarily by transports of moisture from the oceans, where increases in lower-tropospheric temperature and saturated humidity fail to keep pace with those over land. Here, it is argued additionally that constraints on RH imply systematic changes in the cloud distribution and radiative feedbacks over land, as decreased RH raises the lifting condensation level, even as moist instability increases, and suppresses convective clouds. This effect is shown to be particularly strong at low latitudes where the dynamical influence of competing sources of maritime deep convection may further suppress convection. It is found that as a result of the coincidence between strong warming and a muted net greenhouse feedback associated with decreases in RH and clouds, the mean increase in outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) over land (1.0 W m(-2) K-1) in transient simulations at 2200 is almost double that over the ocean (0.6 W m(-2) K-1), and a strong negative net top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative perturbation emerges as the simulations approach and attain equilibrium. However, over the oceans a positive radiative imbalance persists and the increase in water vapor and other greenhouse gases does not allow a local TOA equilibration to occur. The contrast results in an increase in the transport of energy from ocean to land relative to the twentieth century that is accompanied by lasting increases in both OLR and absorbed shortwave radiation globally. A conceptual model to describe the simulated variability is proposed that involves the following: 1) the differing albedos and lower-tropospheric lapse rates over land and ocean, 2) the nonlinearity of the saturated lapse rate in a warming environment, and 3) the disproportionate response in temperature, moisture, clouds, and radiation over land versus ocean. It is noted that while the land-ocean contrast plays a key role in achieving global radiative equilibrium, it entails disproportionate increases in temperature and aridity over land and therefore is likely to be associated with substantial environmental impacts.},

	abstract = {The Pleim-Xiu land surface model, Pleim surface layer scheme, and Asymmetric Convective Model (version 2) are now options in version 3.0 of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) Advanced Research WRF (ARW) core. These physics parameterizations were developed for the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) and have been used extensively by the air quality modeling community, so there was a need based on several factors to extend these parameterizations to WRF. Simulations executed with the new WRF physics are compared with simulations produced with the MM5 and another WRF configuration with a focus on the replication of near-surface meteorological conditions and key planetary boundary layer features. The new physics in WRF is recommended for retrospective simulations, in particular, those used to drive air quality simulations. In the summer, the error of all variables analyzed was slightly lower across the domain in the WRF simulation that used the new physics than in the similar MM5 configuration. This simulation had an even lower error than the other more common WRF configuration. For the cold season case, the model simulation was not as accurate as the other simulations overall, but did well in terms of lower 2-m temperature error in the western part of the model domain ( plains and Rocky Mountains) and most of the Northeast. Both MM5 and the other WRF configuration had lower errors across much of the southern and eastern United States in the winter. The 2-m water vapor mixing ratio and 10-m wind were generally well simulated by the new physics suite in WRF when contrasted with the other simulations and modeling studies. Simulated planetary boundary layer features were compared with both wind profiler and aircraft observations, and the new WRF physics results in a more precise wind and temperature structure not only in the stable boundary layer, but also within most of the convective boundary layer. These results suggest that the WRF performance is now at or above the level of MM5. It is thus recommended to drive future air quality applications.},

The slow component is estimated to be small at present, as measured by the global mean near-surface air temperature, and, in the model examined, grows to 0.4 degrees C by 2100 in the A1B scenario from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), and then to 1.4 degrees C by 2300 if one holds radiative forcing fixed after 2100. The dominance of the fast component at present is supported by examining the response to an instantaneous doubling of CO2 and by the excellent fit to the model's ensemble mean twentieth-century evolution with a simple one-box model with no long times scales.},

	abstract = {Arctic winter surface atmospheric circulation biases inherent to the Community Atmospheric Model version 3 (CAM3) are examined with emphasis on the influence of horizontal resolution (T42, similar to 2.8 degrees versus T85, similar to 1.4 degrees). Using geopotential height at 1000 hPa (Z1000) to represent surface circulation, the self-organizing map technique is used to better understand these biases from a synoptic climatology perspective. The previously documented low sea level pressure (SLP) bias over the Beaufort Sea, Canadian Archipelago, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea, and northern Europe and high SLP bias over the northern Pacific and Atlantic oceans are shown to result from an underprediction of weak Aleutian and Icelandic low patterns and an overprediction of strong Arctic low patterns, strong Icelandic low patterns, and patterns with pronounced ridges spanning the Arctic Ocean. Resolution-caused differences are shown to be the result of CAM3 at T85 resolution predicting fewer strong Icelandic lows, North Atlantic lows, and strong high-pressure ridges across the Arctic relative to CAM3 at T42 resolution. In addition, CAM3 at T85 resolution predicts more strong Arctic low patterns relative to CAM3 at T42 resolution. The ability of CAM3 at both resolutions to resolve mesoscale features such as polar lows near the sea ice edge is also explored. Despite these biases, CAM3 can still be used experimentally to examine atmospheric response to changing climatic conditions, particularly if results are viewed in the framework of a sensitivity study. With this in mind, the impact of future projections of sea ice on winter Arctic circulation is examined at both model resolutions. It is found that weak Arctic low patterns and strong Icelandic low patterns increase in frequency in the winter, while Aleutian/Icelandic low patterns and North Atlantic low/Pacific high patterns decrease in frequency in the winter with future projections of sea ice.},

	abstract = {For the summers of 1993 through 2009, we estimate the loss of multiyear sea ice (MYI) area in the Beaufort Sea due to melt. Parcels of MYI in April are traced into the Beaufort Sea where they melt as the ice edge retreats. Net loss of area (with fractional MYI coverage {\textgreater} 50\%) over the 17-year period is similar to 900 x 10(3) km(2). Three-quarters of that area, similar to 10\% of the area of the Arctic Ocean, was lost after 2000. There is a clear positive trend in the record, with a distinct peak of 213 x 10(3) km(2) in 2008; this is twice the summer outflow at the Fram Strait that year. The net melt area of 490 x 10(3) km(2) between 2005 and 2008 accounts for nearly 32\% of the net loss of 1.54 x 10(6) km(2) of Arctic Ocean MYI coverage over the same period. Volume loss, for the years with ICESat thickness (2004-2009), is highest at 473 km(3) in 2008 followed by 320 km(3) in 2007. Net loss in MYI volume for the six summers is similar to 1400 km(3). This is similar to 20\% of the loss in MYI volume of 6300 km(3) during 2004-2008. This adds to the freshwater content of the Arctic Ocean and locally to the freshening of the Beaufort Gyre.

Less extensive testing was done on the performance of model extensions with alternate areal depletion parameterizations. Model improvements were evaluated through comparisons of point simulations with National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) SWE data for deep-mountain snowpacks at selected stations in the western United States, as well as simulations of snow areal extent over the conterminous United States (CONUS) domain, compared with observational data from the NOAA Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS).

	abstract = {Changes in outgoing radiation are both a consequence and a cause of changes in the earth's temperature. Spencer and Braswell recently showed that in a simple box model for the earth the regression of outgoing radiation against surface temperature gave a slope that differed from the model's true feedback parameter. They went on to select input parameters for the box model based on observations, computed the difference for those conditions, and asserted that there is a significant bias for climate studies. This paper shows that Spencer and Braswell overestimated the difference. Differences between the regression slope and the true feedback parameter are significantly reduced when 1) a more realistic value for the ocean mixed layer depth is used, 2) a corrected standard deviation of outgoing radiation is used, and 3) the model temperature variability is computed over the same time interval as the observations. When all three changes are made, the difference between the slope and feedback parameter is less than one-tenth of that estimated by Spencer and Braswell. Absolute values of the difference for realistic cases are less than 0.05 W m (2) K (1), which is not significant for climate studies that employ regressions of outgoing radiation against temperature. Previously published results show that the difference is negligible in the Hadley Centre Slab Climate Model, version 3 (HadSM3).},

We show that this acceleration was followed by a synchronized and widespread slowdown of the same glaciers, in many cases associated with a decrease in thinning rates, and we propose that ice sheet-ocean interactions are the first-order regional control on these recent mass changes. Sea surface temperature and mooring data show that the preceding dynamic thinning coincides with a brief decline in the cold East Greenland Coastal Current (EGCC) and East Greenland Current. We suggest this decline was partly induced by a reduction in ice sheet runoff, which allowed warm water from the Irminger Current to reach the SE Greenland coast. A restrengthening of the cold waters coincides with the glaciers' subsequent slowdown. We argue that this warming and subsequent cooling of the coastal waters was the cause of the glaciers' dynamic changes. We further suggest that the restrengthening of the EGCC resulted in part from cold water input by increased glacier calving during the speedup and increased ice sheet runoff. We hypothesize that the main mechanism for ice sheet mass loss in SE Greenland is highly sensitive to ocean conditions and is likely subject to negative feedback mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Recent loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic is directly connected to shifts in northern wind patterns in the following autumn, which has the potential of altering the heat budget at the cold end of the global heat engine. With continuing loss of summer sea ice to less than 20\% of its climatological mean over the next decades, we anticipate increased modification of atmospheric circulation patterns. While a shift to a more meridional atmospheric climate pattern, the Arctic Dipole (AD), over the last decade contributed to recent reductions in summer Arctic sea ice extent, the increase in late summer open water area is, in turn, directly contributing to a modification of large scale atmospheric circulation patterns through the additional heat stored in the Arctic Ocean and released to the atmosphere during the autumn season. Extensive regions in the Arctic during late autumn beginning in 2002 have surface air temperature anomalies of greater than 3 degrees C and temperature anomalies above 850 hPa of 1 degrees C. These temperatures contribute to an increase in the 1000-500 hPa thickness field in every recent year with reduced sea ice cover. While gradients in this thickness field can be considered a baroclinic contribution to the flow field from loss of sea ice, atmospheric circulation also has a more variable barotropic contribution. Thus, reduction in sea ice has a direct connection to increased thickness fields in every year, but not necessarily to the sea level pressure (SLP) fields. Compositing wind fields for late autumn 2002-2008 helps to highlight the baroclinic contribution; for the years with diminished sea ice cover there were composite anomalous tropospheric easterly winds of similar to 1.4 m s-1, relative to climatological easterly winds near the surface and upper tropospheric westerlies of similar to 3 m s-1. Loss of summer sea ice is supported by decadal shifts in atmospheric climate patterns. A persistent positive Arctic Oscillation pattern in late autumn (OND) during 1988-1994 and in winter (JFM) during 1989-1997 shifted to more interannual variability in the following years. An anomalous meridional wind pattern with high SLP on the North American side of the Arctic-the AD pattern, shifted from primarily small interannual variability to a persistent phase during spring (AMJ) beginning in 1997 (except for 2006) and extending to summer (JAS) beginning in 2005.},

To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the different GCM responses and their dependence on the background flow, experiments with two idealized models are conducted. Experiments with a linear baroclinic model reveal that the GCM responses at equilibrium are primarily maintained by the anomalous eddy forcing. The anomalous flow induced directly by an idealized initial heat source exhibits little sensitivity to the background flow. Eddy feedbacks on the heating-induced anomalous flow are examined using a linear storm track model. The anomalous eddy forcing produced by the storm track model is sensitive to the basic state. The eddy forcing in January acts to shift the heating-induced upper-level ridge toward the northeast of the Gulf of Alaska, while in February it acts to reinforce the ridge. This sugge...},

	abstract = {The recent overall Northern Hemisphere warming was accompanied by several severe northern continental winters, as for example, extremely cold winter 2005-2006 in Europe and northern Asia. Here we show that anomalous decrease of wintertime sea ice concentration in the Barents-Kara (B-K) seas could bring about extreme cold events like winter 2005-2006. Our simulations with the ECHAM5 general circulation model demonstrate that lower-troposphere heating over the B-K seas in the Eastern Arctic caused by the sea ice reduction may result in strong anticyclonic anomaly over the Polar Ocean and anomalous easterly advection over northern continents. This causes a continental-scale winter cooling reaching -1.5 degrees C, with more than 3 times increased probability of cold winter extremes over large areas including Europe. Our results imply that several recent severe winters do not conflict the global warming picture but rather supplement it, being in qualitative agreement with the simulated large-scale atmospheric circulation realignment. Furthermore, our results suggest that high-latitude atmospheric circulation response to the B-K sea ice decrease is highly nonlinear and characterized by transition from anomalous cyclonic circulation to anticyclonic one and then back again to cyclonic type of circulation as the B-K sea ice concentration gradually reduces from 100\% to ice free conditions. We present a conceptual model that may explain the nonlinear local atmospheric response in the B-K seas region by counter play between convection over the surface heat source and baroclinic effect due to modified temperature gradients in the vicinity of the heating area.},

For the period 2000-2005, monthly means from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) satellite data set are considered to provide the most reliable top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation budget. The remaining components of the energy budget, comprising of the energy storage, horizontal convergence of energy, and the net surface flux between the atmospheric and subsurface columns, are compiled using data from the Japanese 25 Year Reanalysis Project (JRA) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis (NRA). The annual cycles of energy budget components for the polar cap are fairly consistent between the JRA and NRA, but with some systematic differences. JRA depicts an annual mean surface flux of 14 W m(-2) ( upward), compared to only 5 W m(-2) in NRA. Most of this disparity appears to be due to differences in sea ice and albedo. Horizontal atmospheric energy flux divergence calculated using mass-corrected flux values contains artifacts leading to unphysical results. We argue that backing out the energy flux convergence as a residual from the net surface heat flux and time change in energy storage from each reanalysis, and the TOA radiation budget from CERES, provides for more physically realistic results in the Arctic. Monthly mean anomalies of budget terms, used to examine conditions leading to the extreme seasonal sea ice extent minimum of September 2005, point to the importance of albedo feedback.},

Our first question is, "What causes the ocean to warm in the Pacific Sector during the summer"? We find that about 80\% of total heating over this region comes from ocean surface heat flux, with the remaining 20\% originating in ocean lateral heat flux convergence. The latter occurs mostly within a few hundred kilometers of the northwest Alaskan coast. In the summer of 2007, the ocean gained just over twice the amount of heat it did over the average of the previous 7 years. Our second question is, "What causes sea ice to melt in the Pacific Sector during summer"? Our analysis shows that top melt dominates total melt early in the summer, while bottom melt (and in particular, bottom melt due to ocean heat transport) dominates later in the summer as atmospheric heating declines. Bottom melt rates in summer 2007 were 34\% higher relative to the previous 7 year average. The modeled partition of top versus bottom melt closely matches observed melt rates obtained by a drifting buoy. Bottom melting contributes about 2/3 of total volume melt but is geographically confined to the Marginal Ice Zone, while top melting contributes a lesser 1/3 of volume melt but occurs over a much broader area of the ice pack.},

One possible cause of this acceleration is increased melting at the ice-ocean interface(6,7), driven by the synchronous warming(8-10) of subtropical waters offshore of Greenland. However, because of the lack of observations from Greenland's glacial fjords and our limited understanding of their dynamics, this hypothesis is largely untested. Here we present oceanographic data collected in Sermilik Fjord, East Greenland, by ship in summer 2008 and from moorings. Our data reveal the presence of subtropical waters throughout the fjord. These waters are continuously replenished through a wind-driven exchange with the shelf, where they are present all year. The temperature and renewal of these waters indicate that they currently cause enhanced submarine melting at the glacier terminus. Key controls on the melting rate are the volume and properties of the subtropical waters on the shelf, and the patterns of along-shore winds, suggesting that the glaciers' acceleration has been triggered by a combination of atmospheric and oceanic changes. Our measurements provide evidence for a rapid advective pathway for the transmission of oceanic variability to the ice-sheet margins.},

When the NCAR Community Climate Model, version 3, was forced by an exaggerated sea ice extent anomaly corresponding to one arising from a positive NAO, a localized baroclinic response developed and evolved into a larger-scale equivalent barotropic pattern resembling the negative polarity of the NAO. The initial baroclinic response shifted the phase speeds of the dominant eddies away from a critical value equal to the background zonal flow speed, resulting in significant changes in the spatial distribution of RWB. The forcing of the background zonal flow by the changes in RWB accounts for 88\% of the temporal pattern of the response and 80\% of the spatial pattern of the zonally averaged response. Although results here focus on one experiment, this "RWB critical line mechanism'' appears to be relevant to understanding the equilibrium response in a broad class of boundary forcing experiments given increasingly clear connections among the northern annular mode, jet latitude shifts, and RWB.},

	abstract = {To assess climate sensitivity from Earth radiation observations of limited duration and observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) requires a closed and therefore global domain, equilibrium between the fields, and robust methods of dealing with noise. Noise arises from natural variability in the atmosphere and observational noise in precessing satellite observations. This paper explores the meaning of results that use only the tropical region. We compute correlations and regressions between tropical SSTs and top of-atmosphere (TOA) longwave, shortwave and net radiation using a variety of methods to test robustness of results. The main changes in SSTs throughout the tropics are associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in which the dominant changes in energy into an atmospheric column come from ocean heat exchange through evaporation, latent heat release in precipitation, and redistribution of that heat through atmospheric winds. These changes can be an order of magnitude larger than the net TOA radiation changes, and their effects are teleconnected globally, and especially into the subtropics. Atmospheric model results are explored and found to be consistent with observations. From 1985 to 1999 the largest perturbation in TOA radiative fluxes was from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and clearly models which do not include that forcing will not simulate the effects. Consequently, regressions of radiation with SSTs in the tropics may have nothing to say about climate sensitivity. Citation: Trenberth, K. E., J. T. Fasullo, C. O'Dell, and T.

	abstract = {The energy budget of the modern-day Southern Hemisphere is poorly simulated in both state-of-the-art reanalyses and coupled global climate models. The ocean-dominated Southern Hemisphere has low surface reflectivity and therefore its albedo is particularly sensitive to cloud cover. In modern-day climates, mainly because of systematic deficiencies in cloud and albedo at mid-and high latitudes, too much solar radiation enters the ocean. Along with too little radiation absorbed at lower latitudes because of clouds that are too bright, unrealistically weak poleward transports of energy by both the ocean and atmosphere are generally simulated in the Southern Hemisphere. This implies too little baroclinic eddy development and deficient activity in storm tracks. However, projections into the future by coupled climate models indicate that the Southern Ocean features a robust and unique increase in albedo, related to clouds, in association with an intensification and poleward shift in storm tracks that is not observed at any other latitude. Such an increase in cloud may be untenable in nature, as it is likely precluded by the present-day ubiquitous cloud cover that models fail to capture. There is also a remarkably strong relationship between the projected changes in clouds and the simulated current-day cloud errors. The model equilibrium climate sensitivity is also significantly negatively correlated with the Southern Hemisphere energy errors, and only the more sensitive models are in the range of observations. As a result, questions loom large about how the Southern Hemisphere will actually change as global warming progresses, and a better simulation of the modern-day climate is an essential first step.},

	abstract = {Fram Strait is the primary region of sea ice export from the Arctic and therefore plays an important role in regulating the amount of sea ice and freshwater within the Arctic. We investigate the variability of Fram Strait sea ice motion and the role of atmospheric circulation forcing using daily data during the period 1979-2006. The most prominent atmospheric driver of anomalous sea ice motion across Fram Strait is an east-west dipole pattern of Sea Level Pressure (SLP) anomalies with centers of action located over the Barents Sea and Greenland. This pattern, also observed in synoptic studies, is associated with anomalous meridional winds across Fram Strait and is thus physically consistent with forcing changes in sea ice motion. The association between the SLP dipole pattern and Fram Strait ice motion is maximized at 0-lag, persists year-round, and is strongest on time scales of 10-60 days. The SLP dipole pattern is the second empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of daily SLP anomalies in both winter and summer. When the analysis is repeated with monthly data, only the Barents center of the SLP dipole remains significantly correlated with Fram Strait sea ice motion. However, after removing the leading EOF of monthly SLP variability (e.g., the North Atlantic Oscillation), the full east-west dipole pattern is recovered. No significant SLP forcing of Fram Strait ice motion is found in summer using monthly data, even when the leading EOF is removed. Our results highlight the importance of high frequency atmospheric variability in forcing Fram Strait sea ice motion.},

	abstract = {Numerical experiments are conducted to project arctic sea ice responses to varying levels of future anthropogenic warming and climate variability over 2010-2050. A summer ice-free Arctic Ocean is likely by the mid-2040s if arctic surface air temperature (SAT) increases 4 degrees C by 2050 and climate variability is similar to the past relatively warm two decades. If such a SAT increase is reduced by one-half or if a future Arctic experiences a range of SAT fluctuation similar to the past five decades, a summer ice-free Arctic Ocean would be unlikely before 2050. If SAT increases 4 degrees C by 2050, summer ice volume decreases to very low levels (10-37\% of the 1978-2009 summer mean) as early as 2025 and remains low in the following years, while summer ice extent continues to fluctuate annually. Summer ice volume may be more sensitive to warming while summer ice extent more sensitive to climate variability. The rate of annual mean ice volume decrease relaxes approaching 2050. This is because, while increasing SAT increases summer ice melt, a thinner ice cover increases winter ice growth. A thinner ice cover also results in a reduced ice export, which helps to further slow ice volume loss. Because of enhanced winter ice growth, arctic winter ice extent remains nearly stable and therefore appears to be a less sensitive climate indicator. Citation: Zhang, J., M. Steele, and A.

	abstract = {The influence of trends in sea ice concentration ( SIC) and cloud cover on trends in surface temperature over the Arctic Ocean from 1982 to 2004 is investigated analytically, and evaluated empirically with satellite products. The results demonstrate that changes in SIC and cloud cover played major roles in the magnitude of recent Arctic surface temperature trends. Significant surface warming associated with sea ice loss, over 0.9 K decade(-1), is found over the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in autumn, accounting for most of the observed 1.1 K decade(-1) warming trend. If the mean SIC over the Arctic Ocean in each season is reduced by half, our analysis shows that the surface temperature will increase by approximately 10 K in winter and 6 K in spring and autumn. In winter, surface temperature trends associated with changes in cloud cover are negative over most of the Arctic Ocean, and with cloud cover trends explaining -0.91 out of -1.2 K decade(-1) of the surface temperature cooling. In spring, 0.55 K decade(-1) of the total 1.0 K decade(-1) warming can be attributed to the trend associated with cloud cover changes. After eliminating the effects of changes in SIC and cloud cover on surface temperature trends, the residual surface temperature trends can be used in a more robust diagnosis of surface warming or cooling in the Arctic. The same procedure can be applied to study the impact of changes in sea ice thickness, ocean inflow, and other parameters on the temperature trends, and to completely different sets of climate variables, whether they are measured or modeled.

	abstract = {The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is specifically efficient in the analysis of transient and non-stationary signals. As such, it has become a powerful candidate for time—frequency analysis of cardiovascular variability. CWT has already been established as a valid tool for the analysis of single cardiovascular signals, providing additional insights into the autonomous nervous system (ANS) activity and its control mechanism. Intercorrelation between cardiovascular signals elucidates the function of ANS central control and the peripheral reflex mechanisms. Wavelet transform coherence (WTC) can provide insight into the transient linear order of the regulatory mechanisms, via the computation of time—frequency maps of the time-variant coherence. This paper presents a framework for applying WTC for quantitative analysis of coherence in cardiovascular variability research. Computer simulations were performed to estimate the accuracy of the WTC estimates and a method for determining the coherence threshold for specific frequency band was developed and evaluated. Finally, we demonstrated, in two representative situations, the dynamic behaviour of respiration sinus arrhythmia through the analysis of the WTC between heart rate and respiration signals. This emphasizes that CWT and its application to WTC is a useful tool for dynamic analysis of cardiovascular variability., Addressing the Complexity of Cardiovascular Regulation},

	abstract = {A version of the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) has been developed for polar applications. The model known as "Polar WRF'' is tested over the Arctic Ocean with a western Arctic grid using 25-km resolution. The model is based upon WRF version 2.2, with improvements to the Noah land surface model and the snowpack treatment. The ocean surface treatment is modified to include fractional sea ice. Simulations consist of a series of 48-h integrations initialized daily at 0000 UTC. The initial 24 h are taken as model spin-up time for the atmospheric hydrology and boundary layer processes. Arctic conditions are simulated for the selected months: January 1998, June 1998, and August 1998 representing midwinter, early summer, and late summer conditions, respectively, from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) study. The albedo of sea ice is specified as a function of time and latitude for June and as a function of time for August. Simulation results are compared with observations of the drifting ice station SHEBA in the Arctic ice pack. Polar WRF simulations show good agreement with observations for all three months. Some differences between the simulations and observation occur owing to apparent errors in the synoptic forecasts and the representation of clouds. Nevertheless, the biases in the simulated fields appear to be small, and Polar WRF appears to be a very good tool for studies of Arctic Ocean meteorology.},

The emphasis is on atmospheric processes and the resulting modifications in surface conditions such as air temperature, precipitation patterns, and storm track behavior at interannual timescales across the middle and low latitudes of the Northern hemisphere during cool months. Addressed also are the theoretical, methodological, and logistical challenges facing the current observational and modeling studies that aim to improve our awareness of the role that Arctic sea ice plays in the definition of global climate. Moving towards an improved understanding of the role that polar sea ice plays in shaping the global climate is a subject of timely importance as the Arctic environment is currently undergoing rapid change with little slowing down forecasted for the future.

	doi = {10.5751/ES-02849-140134},
	abstract = {In 1973, Ernest Becker, a cultural anthropologist cross-trained in philosophy, sociology, and psychiatry, invoked consciousness of self and the inevitability of death as the primary sources of human anxiety and repression. He proposed that the psychological basis of cooperation, competition, and emotional and mental health is a tendency to hold tightly to anxiety-buffering cultural world views or "immortality projects" that serve as the basis for self-esteem and meaning. Although he focused mainly on social and political outcomes like war, torture, and genocide, he was increasingly aware that materialism, denial of nature, and immortality-striving efforts to control, rather than sanctify, the natural world were problems whose severity was increasing. In this paper I review Becker's ideas and suggest ways in which they illuminate human response to global climate change. Because immortality projects range from belief in technology and materialism to reverence for nature or belief in a celestial god, they act both as barriers to and facilitators of sustainable practices. I propose that Becker's cross-disciplinary "science of man," and the predictions it generates for proximate-level determinants of social behavior, add significantly to our understanding of and potential for managing the people paradox, i.e., that the very things that bring us symbolic immortality often conflict with our prospects for survival. Analysis of immortality projects as one of the proximate barriers to addressing climate change is both cautionary and hopeful, providing insights that should be included in the cross-disciplinary quest to uncover new pathways toward rational, social change.},

	abstract = {High-resolution (similar to 11 km) regional climate modeling shows total annual precipitation on the Greenland ice sheet for 1958-2007 to be up to 24\% and surface mass balance up to 63\% higher than previously thought. The largest differences occur in coastal southeast Greenland, where the much higher resolution facilitates capturing snow accumulation peaks that past five-fold coarser resolution regional climate models missed. The surface mass balance trend over the full 1958-2007 period reveals the classic pattern expected in a warming climate, with increased snowfall in the interior and enhanced runoff from the marginal ablation zone. In the period 1990-2007, total runoff increased significantly, 3\% per year. The absolute increase in runoff is especially pronounced in the southeast, where several outlet glaciers have recently accelerated. This detailed knowledge of Greenland's surface mass balance provides the foundation for estimating and predicting the overall mass balance and freshwater discharge of the ice sheet.

The model illustrates that food system vulnerability is determined by the exposure and sensitivity of the food system to climate-related risks and its adaptive capacity to deal with those risks. The model is empirically applied using a case study from Igloolik, Nunavut. Specifically, the paper focuses on how extreme climate-related conditions in 2006 interacted with the food system to affect food security, using 2006 as a lens to identify and characterize some of the processes and conditions shaping vulnerability, and establishing a baseline for identifying and characterizing processes that are likely to shape future vulnerability. There is a high level of adaptive capacity among Igloolik Inuit, with food sharing mechanisms, hunting flexibility, and store-food access moderating the impact of climatic-risks on food security. However, high fuel and commodity prices, the increasing economic burden of adapting to back-to-back years with unfavorable climatic conditions, underlying community vulnerabilities, and the nature to the climate extremes in 2006, overwhelmed the adaptive capacity of many community members. Those dependent on traditional foods and having limited access to financial resources were particularly vulnerable.},

Here we systematically assess for the first time the influence of oceanographic changes on the ice sheet. The first part of this assessment involves a statistical analysis and interpretation of the relative changes and variations in sea-surface temperature (SSTs) and air temperatures around Greenland for the period 1870-2007. This analysis is based on HadISSTI and Reynolds OI.v2 SST analyses, in situ SST and deeper ocean temperature series, surface-air-temperature records for key points located around the Greenland coast. and examination of atmospheric pressure and geopotential height from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. Second, we carried out a novel sensitivity experiment in which SSTs Were perturbed as input to it regional climate model. and document the resulting effects on simulated Greenland climate and Surface Mass balance. We Conclude that sea-surface/ocean temperature forcing is not sufficient to strongly influence precipitation/snow accumulation and melt/runoff of the ice sheet. Additional evidence front meteorological reanalysis suggests that high Greenland melt anomalies of summer 2007 are likely to have been primarily forced by anomalous advection of warm air masses over the ice sheet and to have therefore had a more remote atmospheric origin. However. there is a striking correspondence between ocean warming and dramatic accelerations and retreats of key Greenland outlet glaciers in both southeast and southwest Greenland during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Over Alaska in particular, a deepening of Aleutian lows is also found to contribute to lower Z1000 in this region. With reduced sea ice, Z1000 increases over Siberia and is found to be the result of increases in the frequency of strong high-pressure ridges. Increases over the Greenland and Norwegian Seas are found to be the result of decreases in frequency of strong Icelandic low cyclones. Large increases in precipitation across the Arctic are found to be primarily due to thermodynamic changes, such as increased moisture in the atmosphere, rather than changes in the frequency of cyclones.

This study combines unique satellite observations with complementary data sets to document Arctic cloud and atmospheric structure during summer and early fall. The analysis focuses on 2006-2008, a period over which ice extent plummeted to record levels, substantial variability in atmospheric circulation patterns occurred, and spaceborne radar and lidar observations of vertical cloud structure became available. The observations show that large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, near-surface static stability, and surface conditions control Arctic cloud cover during the melt season. While no summer cloud response to sea ice loss was found, low clouds did form over newly open water during early fall. This seasonal variation in the cloud response to sea ice loss can be explained by near-surface static stability and air-sea temperature gradients. During summer, temperature inversions and weak air-sea temperature gradients limit atmosphere-ocean coupling. In contrast, relatively low static stability and strong air-sea gradients during early fall permit upward turbulent fluxes of moisture and heat and increased low cloud formation over newly open water. Because of their seasonal timing, cloud changes resulting from sea ice loss play a minor role in regulating ice-albedo feedbacks during summer, but may contribute to a cloud-ice feedback during early fall.},

The observed cloud occurred in a well-mixed boundary layer with a cloud-top temperature of -15 degrees C. The average liquid water path of around 160 g m(-2) was about two-thirds of the adiabatic value and far greater than the average mass of ice which when integrated from the surface to cloud top was around 15 g m(-2).Simulations of 17 single-column models (SCMs) and 9 cloud-resolving models (CRMs) are compared. While the simulated ice water path is generally consistent with observed values, the median SCM and CRM liquid water path is a factor-of-three smaller than observed. Results from a sensitivity study in which models removed ice microphysics suggest that in many models the interaction between liquid and ice-phase microphysics is responsible for the large model underestimate of liquid water path.Despite this underestimate, the simulated liquid and ice water paths of several models are consistent with observed values. Furthermore, models with more sophisticated microphysics simulate liquid and ice water paths that are in better agreement with the observed values, although considerable scatter exists. Although no single factor guarantees a good simulation, these results emphasize the need for improvement in the model representation of mixed-phase microphysics.

Derived ice drafts are consistently within 0.5 m of those from a submarine cruise in mid-November of 2005 and 4 years of ice draft profiles from moorings in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Along with a more than 42\% decrease in multiyear (MY) ice coverage since 2005, there was a remarkable thinning of similar to 0.6 m in MY ice thickness over 4 years. In contrast, the average thickness of the seasonal ice in midwinter (similar to 2 m), which covered more than two-thirds of the Arctic Ocean in 2007, exhibited a negligible trend. Average winter sea ice volume over the period, weighted by a loss of similar to 3000 km(3) between 2007 and 2008, was similar to 14,000 km(3). The total MY ice volume in the winter has experienced a net loss of 6300 km(3) ({\textgreater}40\%) in the 4 years since 2005, while the first-year ice cover gained volume owing to increased overall area coverage. The overall decline in volume and thickness are explained almost entirely by changes in the MY ice cover. Combined with a large decline in MY ice coverage over this short record, there is a reversal in the volumetric and areal contributions of the two ice types to the total volume and area of the Arctic Ocean ice cover. Seasonal ice, having surpassed that of MY ice in winter area coverage and volume, became the dominant ice type. It seems that the near-zero replenishment of the MY ice cover after the summers of 2005 and 2007, an imbalance in the cycle of replenishment and ice export, has played a significant role in the loss of Arctic sea ice volume over the ICESat record.},

A coupled ice-ocean model is used to determine the state of the ice and ocean over the past 29 yr to investigate the causes of this ice extent minimum within a historical perspective. It is found that even though the 2007 ice extent was strongly anomalous, the loss in total ice mass was not. Rather, the 2007 ice mass loss is largely consistent with a steady decrease in ice thickness that began in 1987. Since then, the simulated mean September ice thickness within the Arctic Ocean has declined from 3.7 to 2.6 m at a rate of -0.57 m decade(-1). Both the area coverage of thin ice at the beginning of the melt season and the total volume of ice lost in the summer have been steadily increasing. The combined impact of these two trends caused a large reduction in the September mean ice concentration in the Arctic Ocean. This created conditions during the summer of 2007 that allowed persistent winds to push the remaining ice from the Pacific side to the Atlantic side of the basin and more than usual into the Greenland Sea. This exposed large areas of open water, resulting in the record ice extent anomaly.},

It appears, for the entire tropics, the observed outgoing radiation fluxes increase with the increase in sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The observed behavior of radiation fluxes implies negative feedback processes associated with relatively low climate sensitivity. This is the opposite of the behavior of 11 atmospheric models forced by the same SSTs. Therefore, the models display much higher climate sensitivity than is inferred from ERBE, though it is difficult to pin down such high sensitivities with any precision. Results also show, the feedback in ERBE is mostly from shortwave radiation while the feedback in the models is mostly from longwave radiation. Although such a test does not distinguish the mechanisms, this is important since the inconsistency of climate feedbacks constitutes a very fundamental problem in climate prediction.

	abstract = {Despite recent improvements in satellite instrument calibration and the algorithms used to determine reflected solar (SW) and emitted thermal (LW) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes, a sizeable imbalance persists in the average global net radiation at the TOA from satellite observations. This imbalance is problematic in applications that use earth radiation budget (ERB) data for climate model evaluation, estimate the earth's annual global mean energy budget, and in studies that infer meridional heat transports. This study provides a detailed error analysis of TOA fluxes based on the latest generation of Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) gridded monthly mean data products [the monthly TOA/surface averages geostationary (SRBAVG-GEO)] and uses an objective constrainment algorithm to adjust SW and LW TOA fluxes within their range of uncertainty to remove the inconsistency between average global net TOA flux and heat storage in the earth-atmosphere system. The 5-yr global mean CERES net flux from the standard CERES product is 6.5Wm(-2), much larger than the best estimate of 0.85Wm(-2) based on observed ocean heat content data and model simulations. The major sources of uncertainty in the CERES estimate are from instrument calibration (4.2Wm(-2)) and the assumed value for total solar irradiance (1Wm(-2)). After adjustment, the global mean CERES SW TOA flux is 99.5Wm(-2), corresponding to an albedo of 0.293, and the global mean LW TOA flux is 239.6Wm(-2). These values differ markedly from previously published adjusted global means based on the ERB Experiment in which the global mean SW TOA flux is 107Wm(-2) and the LW TOA flux is 234Wm(-2).},

	abstract = {Results are presented from an intercomparison of single-column and cloud-resolving model simulations of a deep, multilayered, mixed-phase cloud system observed during the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment. This cloud system was associated with strong surface turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes as cold air flowed over the open Arctic Ocean, combined with a low pressure system that supplied moisture at mid-levels. The simulations, performed by 13 single-column and 4 cloud-resolving models, generally overestimate liquid water path and strongly underestimate ice water path, although there is a large spread among models. This finding is in contrast with results for the single-layer, low-level mixed-phase stratocumulus case in Part I, as well as previous studies of shallow mixed-phase Arctic clouds, that showed an underprediction of liquid water path. These results suggest important differences in the ability of models to simulate deeper Arctic mixed-phase clouds versus the shallow, single-layered mixed-phase clouds in Part I. The observed liquid-ice mass ratios were much smaller than in Part I, despite the similarity of cloud temperatures. Thus, models employing microphysics schemes with temperature-based partitioning of cloud liquid and ice masses are not able to produce results consistent with observations for both cases. Models with more sophisticated, two-moment treatment of cloud microphysics produce a somewhat smaller liquid water path closer to observations. Cloud-resolving models tend to produce a larger cloud fraction than single-column models. The liquid water path and cloud fraction have a large impact on the cloud radiative forcing at the surface, which is dominated by long-wave flux. Copyright (C) 2009 Royal Meteorological Society},

About 20\% of the integrated positive forcing by greenhouse gases and solar radiation since 1950 has been radiated to space. Only about 10\% of the positive forcing (about 1/3 of the net forcing) has gone into heating the Earth, almost all into the oceans. About 20\% of the positive forcing has been balanced by volcanic aerosols, and the remaining 50\% is mainly attributable to tropospheric aerosols. After accounting for the measured terms, the residual forcing between 1970 and 2000 due to direct and indirect forcing by aerosols as well as semidirect forcing from greenhouse gases and any unknown mechanism can be estimated as -1.1 +/- 0.4 W m(-2) (1 sigma). This is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's best estimates but rules out very large negative forcings from aerosol indirect effects. Further, the data imply an increase from the 1950s to the 1980s followed by constant or slightly declining aerosol forcing into the 1990s, consistent with estimates of trends in global sulfate emissions. An apparent increase in residual forcing in the late 1990s is discussed.},

	abstract = {The recent marked retreat, thinning and acceleration of most of Greenland's outlet glaciers south of 70 degrees N has increased concerns over Greenland's contribution to future sea level rise(1-5). These dynamic changes seem to be parallel to the warming trend in Greenland, but the mechanisms that link climate and ice dynamics are poorly understood, and current numerical models of ice sheets do not simulate these changes realistically(6-8). Uncertainties in the predictions of mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet have therefore been highlighted as one of the main limitations in forecasting future sea levels(9). Here we present a numerical ice-flow model that reproduces the observed marked changes in Helheim Glacier, one of Greenland's largest outlet glaciers. Our simulation shows that the ice acceleration, thinning and retreat begin at the calving terminus and then propagate upstream through dynamic coupling along the glacier. We find that these changes are unlikely to be caused by basal lubrication through surface melt propagating to the glacier bed. We conclude that tidewater outlet glaciers adjust extremely rapidly to changing boundary conditions at the calving terminus. Our results imply that the recent rates of mass loss in Greenland's outlet glaciers are transient and should not be extrapolated into the future.},

In the experiment with projected sea-ice concentrations significant reductions in storminess were found during December and January in both midlatitudes and towards the Arctic. However, a substantially larger reduction in extratropical storminess was found in March, despite a smaller change in surface energy fluxes in March than in the other winter months. The projected decrease in storminess is also related to the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The March response is consistent with a forcing from transient and quasi-stationary eddies associated with negative NAO events. The greater sensitivity to sea-ice anomalies in late winter sets this study apart from earlier ones.},

Sea ice variability is quantified based on the leading empirical orthogonal function of sea ice concentration over the North Atlantic [the Greenland Sea ice dipole (GSD)], which, in its positive polarity, has anomalously high sea ice concentrations in the Labrador Sea region to the southwest of Greenland and low sea ice concentrations in the Barents Sea region to the northeast of Greenland. In weekly data for December through April, the VAR indicates that NAO index (N) anomalies cause like-signed anomalies of the standardized GSD index (G), and that G anomalies in turn cause oppositely signed anomalies of N. This negative feedback process operates explicitly on lags of up to four weeks in the VAR but can generate more persistent effects because of the autocorrelation of G. Synthetic data are generated with the VAR to quantify the effects of feedback following realistic local maxima of N and G, and also for sustained high values of G. Feedback can change the expected value of evolving system variables by as much as a half a standard deviation, and the relevance of these results to intraseasonal and interannual NAO and sea ice variability is discussed.},

In 1997, Kiehl and Trenberth provided a review of past estimates and performed a number of radiative computations to better establish the role of clouds and various greenhouse gases in the overall radiative energy flows, with top-of-atmosphere (TOA) values constrained by Earth Radiation Budget Experiment values from 1985 to 1989, when the TOA values were approximately in balance. The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) measurements from March 2000 to May 2004 are used at TOA but adjusted to an estimated imbalance from the enhanced greenhouse effect of 0.9 W m−2. Revised estimates of surface turbulent fluxes are made based on various sources. The partitioning of solar radiation in the atmosphere is based in part on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) FD computations that utilize the global ISCCP cloud data every 3 h, and also accounts for increased atmospheric absorption by water vapor and aerosols.Surface upward longwave radiation is adjusted to account for spatial and temporal variability. A lack of closure in the energy balance at the surface is accommodated by making modest changes to surface fluxes, with the downward longwave radiation as the main residual to ensure a balance.Values are also presented for the land and ocean domains that include a net transport of energy from ocean to land of 2.2 petawatts (PW) of which 3.2 PW is from moisture (latent energy) transport, while net dry static energy transport is from land to ocean. Evaluations of atmospheric re-analyses reveal substantial biases.},

While there is a large increase in the greenhouse effect from increasing greenhouse gases and water vapor (as a feedback), this is offset to a large degree by a decreasing greenhouse effect from reducing cloud cover and increasing radiative emissions from higher temperatures. Instead the main warming from an energy budget standpoint comes from increases in absorbed solar radiation that stem directly from the decreasing cloud amounts. These findings underscore the need to ascertain the credibility of the model changes, especially insofar as changes in clouds are concerned. Citation: Trenberth, K. E., and J. T.

	abstract = {Arctic radiative fluxes, cloud fraction, and cloud radiative forcing are evaluated from four currently available reanalysis models using data from the North Slope of Alaska (NSA) Barrow site of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM). A primary objective of the ARM-NSA program is to provide a high-resolution dataset of direct measurements of Arctic clouds and radiation so that global climate models can better parameterize high-latitude cloud radiative processes. The four reanalysis models used in this study are the 1) NCEP-NCAR global reanalysis, 2) 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), 3) NCEP-NCAR North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), and 4) Japan Meteorological Agency and Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry 25-yr Reanalysis (JRA25). The reanalysis models simulate the radiative fluxes well if/when the cloud fraction is simulated correctly. However, the systematic errors of climatological reanalysis cloud fractions are substantial. Cloud fraction and radiation biases show considerable scatter, both in the annual mean and over a seasonal cycle, when compared to those observed at the ARM-NSA. Large seasonal cloud fraction biases have significant impacts on the surface energy budget. Detailed comparisons of ARM and reanalysis products reveal that the persistent low-level cloud fraction in summer is particularly difficult for the reanalysis models to capture creating biases in the shortwave radiation flux that can exceed 160 W m(-2). ERA-40 is the best performer in both shortwave and longwave flux seasonal representations at Barrow, largely because its simulation of the cloud coverage is the most realistic of the four reanalyses. Only two reanalyses (ERA-40 and NARR) capture the observed transition from positive to negative surface net cloud radiative forcing during a 2-3-month period in summer, while the remaining reanalyses indicate a net warming impact of Arctic clouds on the surface energy budget throughout the entire year. The authors present a variable cloud radiative forcing metric to diagnose the erroneous impact of reanalysis cloud fraction on the surface energy balance. The misrepresentations of cloud radiative forcing in some of the reanalyses are attributable to errors in both simulated cloud amounts and the models' radiative response to partly cloudy conditions.},

	abstract = {The connection between sea ice variability and cloud cover over the Arctic seas during autumn is investigated by analyzing the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) products and the Television and Infrared Observation Satellite ( TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) Polar Pathfinder satellite datasets. It is found that cloud cover variability near the sea ice margins is strongly linked to sea ice variability. Sea ice retreat is linked to a decrease in low-level cloud amount and a simultaneous increase in midlevel clouds. This pattern is apparent in both data sources. Changes in cloud cover can be explained by changes in the atmospheric temperature structure and an increase in near-surface temperatures resulting from the removal of sea ice. The subsequent decrease in static stability and deepening of the atmospheric boundary layer apparently contribute to the rise in cloud level. The radiative effect of this change is relatively small, as the direct radiative effects of cloud cover changes are compensated for by changes in the temperature and humidity profiles associated with varying ice conditions.},

	abstract = {The combined land and ocean surface temperature in 2007 fell within the 10 highest on record while the average land temperature was the warmest since global records began in 1880. In the low to midtroposphere, the annual global mean temperature was among the five warmest since reliable global records began in 1958, but still cooler than the record warmest year of 1998. For the fourth consecutive year, the annual precipitation averaged over global land surfaces was above the long-term mean, although the anomaly was significantly less than in 2006 when the annual value was the eighth wettest since 1901.The globally averaged concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) continued to increase in 2007, having risen to 382.7 ppm at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. The average rate of rise of CO2 has been 1.6 ppm yr(-1) since 1980; however, since 2000 this has increased to 1.9 ppm yr(-1). In addition, both methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations were also higher in 2007.Over the oceans, global SST during 2007 showed significant departures from the 1971-2000 climatology. Annual average upper-ocean heat content anomalies declined between 2006 and 2007 in the eastern equatorial Pacific and increased in off-equatorial bands in that ocean basin. These changes were consistent with the transition from an El Nino in 2006 to a La Nina in 2007. The global mean see level anomaly (SLA) in 2007 was 1.1 mm higher than in 2006, which is about one standard deviation below what would be excepted from the 15-yr trend value of 3.4 mm yr(-1).In the tropics, the Atlantic hurricane season was near normal in 2007, although slightly more active than in 2006. In the north and south Indian Ocean Basins, both the seasonal totals and intensity of tropical cyclones (TC) were significantly above average, and included two Saffir-Simpson category 5 TCs in the north Indian Ocean and a world record rainfall amount of 5510 mm over a 3-8 day period on the island of Reunion in the south Indian Ocean.In the polar regions 2007 was the warmest on record for the Arctic, and continued a general, Arctic-wide warming trend that began in the mid-1960s. An unusually strong high pressure region in the Beaufort Sea during summer contributed to a record minimum Arctic sea ice cover in September. Measurements of the mass balance of glaciers and ice caps indicate that in most of the world, glaciers and ice caps indicate that in most of the world, glaciers are shrinking in mass. The Greenland ice sheet experienced records in both the duration and extent of the summer surface melt. From the continental scale as a whole the Antarctic was warmer than average in 2007, although the Antarctic Peninsula was considerably cooler than average. The size of the ozone hole was below the record levels of 2006, and near the average of the past 15 yr, due to warmer springtime temperatures in the Antarctic stratosphere.},

	abstract = {Loss of Arctic sea ice has accelerated recently, culminating in a 2007 summer minimum ice extent that was 23\% below the previous low. To quantify the impact of this unprecedented loss of ice on marine primary production, we have coupled satellite-derived sea ice, SST, and chlorophyll to a primary production algorithm parameterized for Arctic waters. Annual primary production in the Arctic has increased yearly by an average of 27.5 Tg C yr(-1) since 2003 and by 35 Tg C yr(-1) between 2006 and 2007. 30\% of this increase is attributable to decreased minimum summer ice extent and 70\% to a longer phytoplankton growing season. Should these trends continue, additional loss of ice during Arctic spring could boost productivity {\textgreater}3-fold above 1998-2002 levels, potentially altering marine ecosystem structure and the degree of pelagic-benthic coupling. Changes in carbon export could in turn modify benthic denitrification on the vast continental shelves.},

	abstract = {The mean and annual cycle of energy flowing into the climate system and its storage, release, and transport in the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface are estimated with recent observations. An emphasis is placed on establishing internally consistent quantitative estimates with discussion and assessment of uncertainty. At the top of the atmosphere (TOA), adjusted radiances from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) are used, while in the atmosphere the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis and 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) estimates are used. The net upward surface flux (F-S) over ocean is derived as the residual of the TOA and atmospheric energy budgets, and is compared with direct calculations of ocean heat content (O-E) and its tendency (delta O-E/delta t) from several ocean temperature datasets. Over land, F-S from a stand-alone simulation of the Community Land Model forced by observed fields is used. A depiction of the full energy budget based oil ERBE fluxes from 1985 to 1989 and CERES fluxes from 2000 to 2004 is constructed that matches estimates of the global, global ocean, and global land imbalances. In addition, the annual cycle of the energy budget during both periods is examined and compared with ocean heat content changes. The near balance between the net TOA radiation (R-T) and F-S over ocean and thus with O-E, and between R-T and atmospheric total energy divergence over land, are documented both in the mean and for the annual cycle. However, there is an annual mean transport of energy by the atmosphere from ocean to land regions of 2.2 +/- 0.1 PW (1 PW = 10(15) W) primarily in the northern winter when the transport exceeds 5 PW. The global albedo is dominated by a semiannual cycle over the oceans, but combines with the large annual cycle in solar insolation to produce a peak in absorbed solar and net radiation in February, somewhat after the perihelion, and with the net radiation 4.3 PW higher than the annual mean, as it is enhanced by the annual cycle of outgoing longwave radiation that is dominated by land regions. In situ estimates of the annual variation of O-E are found to be unrealistically large. Challenges in diagnosing the interannual variability in the energy budget and its relationship to climate change are identified in the context of the episodic and inconsistent nature of the observations.},

At the top of the atmosphere (TOA), adjusted radiances from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) are used along with estimates of energy storage and transport from two global reanalysis datasets for the atmosphere. Three ocean temperature datasets are used to assess changes in the ocean heat content (O-E) and their relationship to the net upward Surface energy flux over ocean (F-S(0)), which is derived from the residual of the TOA and atmospheric energy budgets. The surface flux over land is from a stand-alone simulation of the Community Land Model forced by observed fields. In the extratropics, absorbed solar radiation (ASR) achieves a maximum in summer with peak values near the solstices. Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) maxima also occur in summer but lag ASR by 1-2 months, consistent with temperature maxima over land. In the tropics, however, OLR relates to high cloud variations and peaks late in the dry monsoon season, while the OLR minima in summer coincide with deep convection in the monsoon trough at the height of the rainy season. Most of the difference between the TOA radiation and atmospheric energy storage tendency is made up by a large heat flux into the ocean in summer and out of the ocean in winter. In the Northern Hemisphere, the transport of energy from ocean to land regions is substantial in winter, and modest in summer. In the Southern Hemisphere extratropics, land - ocean differences play only a small role and the main energy transport by the atmosphere and ocean is poleward. There is reasonably good agreement between F-S(0) and observed changes in O-E except for south of 40 degrees S, where differences among several ocean datasets point to that region as the main source of errors in achieving an overall energy balance. The winter hemisphere atmospheric circulation is the dominant contributor to poleward energy transports outside of the tropics [6-7 PW (1 petawatt = 10(15) W)], With summer transports being relatively weak (similar to 3 PW)-slightly more in the Southern Hemisphere and slightly less in the Northern Hemisphere. Ocean transports outside of the tropics are found to be small ({\textless}2 PW) for all months. Strong cross-equatorial heat transports in the ocean of up to 5 PW exhibit a large annual cycle in phase with poleward atmospheric transports of the winter hemisphere.},

	doi = {10.1175/2008JHM946.1},
	abstract = {Reanalysis data are an important source of information for hydrometeorology applications, which use data assimilation to combine an imperfect atmospheric model with uncertain observations. However, uncertainty estimates are not normally provided with reanalyses. The model "first guess" (6-h forecast) is sometimes saved along with reanalysis estimates, which allows the calculation of the analysis increment (AI), defined as the analysis minus the model first guess. Analysis increment statistics could provide a quantitative index for comparing models in regions with sufficient observations. Monthly analysis increment statistics for the NCEP-NCAR Global Reanalysis 1 (NCEP-R1) and the NCEP/Department of Energy Global Reanalysis 2 (NCEP-R2) are computed for a North American and South American location for zonal and meridional wind and specific humidity at three atmospheric levels for 1998-2001. NCEP-R2 specific humidity was found to have a smaller mean monthly standard deviation of the analysis increment than NCEP-R1 at the North American location at the 300-mb level. The NCEP-R2 specific humidity monthly standard deviation at the South American location is much larger than NCEP-R1 for September November 1998, which may be related to the transition to La Nina. For both zonal and meridional wind, the monthly AI standard deviations are similar for NCEP-R1 and NCEP-R2 at all atmospheric levels for the North American location. The South American location exhibits similar behavior for the wind AI statistics as for specific humidity: NCEP-R2 has a much larger monthly standard deviation of the AI for September November 1998. The analysis increment statistics could be one method for quantitatively comparing reanalyses. First guess information should be available to the user in reanalysis archives.},

	doi = {10.1038/nature06502},
	abstract = {Near- surface warming in the Arctic has been almost twice as large as the global average over recent decades(1-5) - a phenomenon that is known as the 'Arctic amplification'. The underlying causes of this temperature amplification remain uncertain. The reduction in snow and ice cover that has occurred over recent decades(6,7) may have played a role(5,8). Climate model experiments indicate that when global temperature rises, Arctic snow and ice cover retreats, causing excessive polar warming(9-11). Reduction of the snow and ice cover causes albedo changes, and increased refreezing of sea ice during the cold season and decreases in sea- ice thickness both increase heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere. Changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation, as well as cloud cover, have also been proposed to cause Arctic temperature amplification(12-17). Here we examine the vertical structure of temperature change in the Arctic during the late twentieth century using reanalysis data. We find evidence for temperature amplification well above the surface. Snow and ice feedbacks cannot be the main cause of the warming aloft during the greater part of the year, because these feedbacks are expected to primarily affect temperatures in the lowermost part of the atmosphere, resulting in a pattern of warming that we only observe in spring. A significant proportion of the observed temperature amplification must therefore be explained by mechanisms that induce warming above the lowermost part of the atmosphere. We regress the Arctic temperature field on the atmospheric energy transport into the Arctic and find that, in the summer half- year, a significant proportion of the vertical structure of warming can be explained by changes in this variable. We conclude that changes in atmospheric heat transport may be an important cause of the recent Arctic temperature amplification.},

To continue the goal of enhanced polar mesoscale modeling, polar optimization should now be applied toward the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. Evaluations and optimizations are especially needed for the boundary layer parameterization, cloud physics, snow surface physics, and sea ice treatment. Testing and development work for Polar WRF begins with simulations for ice sheet surface conditions using a Greenland-area domain with 24-km resolution. The winter month December 2002 and the summer month June 2001 are simulated with WRF, version 2.1.1, in a series of 48-h integrations initialized daily at 0000 UTC. The results motivated several improvements to Polar WRF, especially to the Noah land surface model (LSM) and the snowpack treatment. Different physics packages for WRF are evaluated with December 2002 Simulations that show variable forecast skill when verified with the automatic weather station observations. The WRF simulation with the combination of the modified Noah LSM, the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic boundary layer parameterization, and the WRF single-moment microphysics produced results that reach or exceed the success standards of a Polar MM5 simulation for December 2002. For summer simulations of June 2001, WRF simulates an improved surface energy balance, and shows forecast skill nearly equal to that of Polar MM5.},

	abstract = {Observations over the past decades show a rapid acceleration of several outlet glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica(1). One of the largest changes is a sudden switch of Jakobshavn Isbrae, a large outlet glacier feeding a deep-ocean fjord on Greenland's west coast, from slow thickening to rapid thinning(2) in 1997, associated with a doubling in glacier velocity(3). Suggested explanations for the speed-up of Jakobshavn Isbrae include increased lubrication of the ice-bedrock interface as more meltwater has drained to the glacier bed during recent warmer summers(4) and weakening and break-up of the floating ice tongue that buttressed the glacier(5). Here we present hydrographic data that show a sudden increase in subsurface ocean temperature in 1997 along the entire west coast of Greenland, suggesting that the changes in Jakobshavn Isbrae were instead triggered by the arrival of relatively warm water originating from the Irminger Sea near Iceland. We trace these oceanic changes back to changes in the atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic region. We conclude that the prediction of future rapid dynamic responses of other outlet glaciers to climate change will require an improved understanding of the effect of changes in regional ocean and atmosphere circulation on the delivery of warm subsurface waters to the periphery of the ice sheets.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional ocean general circulation model is used to study the response of idealized ice shelves to a series of ocean-warming scenarios. The model predicts that the total ice shelf basal melt increases quadratically as the ocean offshore of the ice front warms. This occurs because the melt rate is proportional to the product of ocean flow speed and temperature in the mixed layer directly beneath the ice shelf, both of which are found to increase linearly with ocean warming. The behavior of this complex primitive equation model can be described surprisingly well with recourse to an idealized reduced system of equations, and it is shown that this system supports a melt rate response to warming that is generally quadratic in nature. This study confirms and unifies several previous examinations of the relation between melt rate and ocean temperature but disagrees with other results, particularly the claim that a single melt rate sensitivity to warming is universally valid. The hypothesized warming does not necessarily require a heat input to the ocean, as warmer waters (or larger volumes of "warm" water) may reach ice shelves purely through a shift in ocean circulation. Since ice shelves link the Antarctic Ice Sheet to the climate of the Southern Ocean, this finding of an above-linear rise in ice shelf mass loss as the ocean steadily warms is of significant importance to understanding ice sheet evolution and sea level rise.},

The clearer skies led to downwelling shortwave (longwave) radiative fluxes increases of +32 Wm(-2) (-4 Wm(-2)) from 2006 to 2007. Over three months, simple calculations show that these radiation differences alone could enhance surface ice melt by 0.3 m, or warm the surface ocean by 2.4 K, which enhances basal ice melt. Increased air temperatures and decreased relative humidity associated with an anticyclonic atmospheric circulation pattern explain the reduced cloudiness. Longer-term observations show that the 2007 cloudiness is anomalous in the recent past, but is not unprecedented. Thus, in a warmer world with thinner ice, natural summertime circulation and cloud variability is an increasingly important control on sea ice extent minima.},

We find that simulated western Arctic land warming trends during rapid sea ice loss are 3.5 times greater than secular 21st century climate-change trends. The accelerated warming signal penetrates up to 1500 km inland and is apparent throughout most of the year, peaking in autumn. Idealized experiments using the Community Land Model, with improved permafrost dynamics, indicate that an accelerated warming period substantially increases ground heat accumulation. Enhanced heat accumulation leads to rapid degradation of warm permafrost and may increase the vulnerability of colder permafrost to degradation under continued warming.

	abstract = {How well can the extent of arctic sea ice be predicted for lead periods of up to one year? The forecast ability of a linear empirical model is explored. It uses as predictors historical information about the ocean and ice obtained from an ice-ocean model retrospective analysis. The monthly model fields are represented by a correlation-weighted average based on the predicted ice extent. The forecast skill of the procedure is found by fitting the model over subsets of the available data and then making subsequent projections using independent predictor data. The forecast skill, relative to climatology, for predictions of the observed September ice extent for the pan-arctic region is 0.77 for six months lead (from March) and 0.75 for 11 months lead (from October). The ice concentration is the most important variable for the first two months and the ocean temperature of the model layer with a depth of 200 to 270 m is most important for longer lead times. The trend accounts for 76\% of the variance of the pan-arctic ice extent, so most of the forecast skill is realized by determining model variables that best represent this trend. For detrended data there is no skill for lead times of 3 months or more. The forecast skill relative to the estimate from the previous year is lower than the climate-relative skill but it is still greater than 0.45 for most lead times. Six-month predictions are also made for each month of the year and regional three-month predictions are made for 45-degree sectors.

This study suggests alternative methods that can be more skillful than the traditional one in obtaining high-resolution climate information. We use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with a grid spacing at 36 km over the conterminous U.S. to dynamically downscale the 1-degree NCEP Global Final Analysis (FNL). We perform three types of experiments for the entire year of 2000: (1) continuous integrations with a single initialization as usually done, (2) consecutive integrations with frequent re-initializations, and (3) as (1) but with a 3-D nudging being applied. The simulations are evaluated in a high temporal scale (6-hourly) by comparison with the 32-km NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). Compared to NARR, the downscaling simulation using the 3-D nudging shows the highest skill, and the continuous run produces the lowest skill. While the re-initialization runs give an intermediate skill, a run with a more frequent (e.g., weekly) re-initialization outperforms that with the less frequent re-initialization (e.g., monthly). Dynamical downscaling outperforms bi-linear interpolation, especially for meteorological fields near the surface over the mountainous regions. The 3-D nudging generates realistic regional-scale patterns that are not resolved by simply updating the lateral boundary conditions as done traditionally, therefore significantly improving the accuracy of generating regional climate information.},

The results indicate three primary LLJs in the region. The largest and most dominant LLJ is along the Transantarctic Mountains by the Siple Coast and the southern end of the Ross Ice Shelf. The second LLJ extends from the base of Byrd Glacier and curves to the north passing by the eastern extremes of Ross Island. The third LLJ extends from the base of Reeves Glacier and curves to the north across the western Ross Sea. A strong seasonality is observed in the frequency and intensity of the LLJs with the highest values for wind speed and the size of the LLJ at a maximum during the winter and spring months.},

	abstract = {Ocean temperature profiles and satellite data have been analyzed for summertime sea surface temperature (SST) and upper ocean heat content variations over the past century, with a focus on the Arctic Ocean peripheral seas. We find that many areas cooled up to similar to 0.5 degrees C per decade during 1930-1965 as the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index generally fell, while these areas warmed during 1965-1995 as the AO index generally rose. Warming is particularly pronounced since 1995, and especially since 2000. Summer 2007 SST anomalies are up to 5 degrees C. The increase in upper ocean summertime warming since 1965 is sufficient to reduce the following winter's ice growth by as much as 0.75 m. Alternatively, this heat may return to the atmosphere before any ice forms, representing a fall freeze-up delay of two weeks to two months. This returned heat might be carried by winds over terrestrial tundra ecosystems, contributing to the local heat budget.},

	abstract = {The subtidal circulation of the southeast Greenland shelf is described using a set of high-resolution hydrographic and velocity transects occupied in summer 2004. The main feature is the East Greenland Coastal Current (EGCC), a low-salinity, high-velocity jet with a wedge-shaped hydrographic structure characteristic of other surface buoyancy-driven currents. The EGCC was observed along the entire Greenland shelf south of Denmark Strait, while the transect north of the strait showed only a weak shelf flow. This observation, in conjunction with water mass considerations and other supporting evidence, suggests that the EGCC is an inner branch of the East Greenland Current (EGC) that forms south of Denmark Strait. It is argued that bathymetric steering is the most likely reason why the EGC apparently bifurcates at this location. Repeat sections occupied at Cape Farewell between 1997 and 2004 show that the alongshelf wind stress can have an influence on the structure and strength of the EGCC and EGC on timescales of 2-3 days. Accounting for the wind-induced effects, the volume transport of the combined EGCC/EGC system is roughly constant (similar to 2 Sv) over the study domain, from 68 degrees N to Cape Farewell near 60 degrees N. The corresponding freshwater transport increases by roughly 60\% over this distance (59-96 mSv, referenced to a salinity of 34.8). This trend is consistent with a simple freshwater budget of the EGCC/ECC system that accounts for meltwater runoff, melting sea-ice and icebergs, and net precipitation minus evaporation.

	abstract = {Monthly net surface energy fluxes (F-S) over the oceans are computed as residuals of the atmospheric energy budget using top- of- atmosphere (TOA) net radiation (RT) and the complete atmospheric energy (A(E)) budget tendency (delta A(E)/delta t) and divergence (del center dot F-A). The focus is on TOA radiation from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) (February 1985 - April 1989) and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) (March 2000 - May 2004) satellite observations combined with results from two atmospheric reanalyses and three ocean datasets that enable a comprehensive estimate of uncertainties. Surface energy flux departures from the annual mean and the implied annual cycle in "equivalent ocean energy content" are compared with the directly observed ocean energy content (O-E) and tendency (delta O-E/delta t) to reveal the inferred annual cycle of divergence (del center dot F-O). In the extratropics, the surface flux dominates the ocean energy tendency, although it is supplemented by ocean Ekman transports that enhance the annual cycle in ocean heat content. In contrast, in the tropics, ocean dynamics dominate OE variations throughout the year in association with the annual cycle in surface wind stress and the North Equatorial Current. An analysis of the regional characteristics of the first joint empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of F-S, delta O-E/delta t, and del center dot F-O is presented, and the largest sources of uncertainty are attributed to variations in OE. The mean and annual cycle of zonal mean global ocean meridional heat transports are estimated. The annual cycle reveals the strongest poleward heat transports in each hemisphere in the cold season, from November to April in the north and from May to October in the south, with a substantial across-equatorial transport, exceeding 4 PW in some months. Annual mean results do not differ greatly from some earlier estimates, but the sources of uncertainty are exposed. Comparison of annual means with direct ocean observations gives reasonable agreement, except in the North Atlantic, where transports from the ocean transects are slightly greater than the estimates presented here.},

	abstract = {Eight atmospheric regional climate models (RCMs) were run for the period September 1997 to October 1998 over the western Arctic Ocean. This period was coincident with the observational campaign of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) project. The RCMs shared common domains, centred on the SHEBA observation camp, along with a common model horizontal resolution, but differed in their vertical structure and physical parameterizations. All RCMs used the same lateral and surface boundary conditions. Surface downwelling solar and terrestrial radiation, surface albedo, vertically integrated water vapour, liquid water path and cloud cover from each model are evaluated against the SHEBA observation data. Downwelling surface radiation, vertically integrated water vapour and liquid water path are reasonably well simulated at monthly and daily timescales in the model ensemble mean, but with considerable differences among individual models. Simulated surface albedos are relatively accurate in the winter season, but become increasingly inaccurate and variable in the melt season, thereby compromising the net surface radiation budget. Simulated cloud cover is more or less uncorrelated with observed values at the daily timescale. Even for monthly averages, many models do not reproduce the annual cycle correctly. The inter-model spread of simulated cloud-cover is very large, with no model appearing systematically superior. Analysis of the co-variability of terms controlling the surface radiation budget reveal some of the key processes requiring improved treatment in Arctic RCMs. Improvements in the parameterization of cloud amounts and surface albedo are most urgently needed to improve the overall performance of RCMs in the Arctic.},

	abstract = {The new satellite-derived Swiss glacier inventory revealed that mean glacier area loss per decade from 1985 to 1998/99 has accelerated by a factor of seven compared to the period 1850-1973. Moreover, the satellite data display much evidence that down-wasting (i.e. stationary thinning) has become a major source of glacier mass loss, an observation that is confirmed by in situ mass balance measurements. Many of the observed changes (growing rock outcrops, tongue separation, formation of pro-glacial lakes, albedo lowering, collapse structures) are related to positive feedbacks which accelerate further glacier disintegration once they are initiated. As such, it is unlikely that the recent trend of glacier wastage will stop (or reverse) in the near future. In view of the rapid non-uniform geometry changes, special challenges emerged for the recently established tiered glacier monitoring strategy within the framework of the Global Climate/Terrestrial Observing System (GCOS/GTOS). The challenges include: (1) loss of mass balance series due to disintegrating glaciers, (2) problematic extrapolation of index stake measurements from a calibration period under different climate conditions, (3) critical evaluation of measured length changes, (4) establishment of an operational glacier inventorying strategy using satellite data and (5) the calculation of new topographic parameters after glacier split up that can be compared to previous parameters.},

	abstract = {[1] The reliability of the global reanalyses in the polar regions is investigated. The overview stems from an April 2006 Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research ( SCAR) workshop on the performance of global reanalyses in high latitudes held at the British Antarctic Survey. Overall, the skill is much higher in the Arctic than the Antarctic, where the reanalyses are only reliable in the summer months prior to the modern satellite era. In the Antarctic, large circulation differences between the reanalyses are found primarily before 1979, when vast quantities of satellite sounding data started to be assimilated. Specifically for ERA-40, this data discontinuity creates a marked jump in Antarctic snow accumulation, especially at high elevations. In the Arctic, the largest differences are related to the reanalyses' depiction of clouds and their associated radiation impacts; ERA-40 captures the cloud variability much better than NCEP1 and JRA- 25, but the ERA-40 and JRA- 25 clouds are too optically thin for shortwave radiation. To further contrast the reanalyses skill, cyclone tracking results are presented. In the Southern Hemisphere, cyclonic activity is markedly different between the reanalyses, where there are few matched cyclones prior to 1979. In comparison, only some of the weaker cyclones are not matched in the Northern Hemisphere from 1958 - 2001, again indicating the superior skill in this hemisphere. Although this manuscript focuses on deficiencies in the reanalyses, it is important to note that they are a powerful tool for climate studies in both polar regions when used with a recognition of their limitations.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to investigate the transient evolution of the wintertime atmospheric circulation response to imposed patterns of SST and sea ice extent anomalies in the North Atlantic sector using a large ensemble of experiments with the NCAR Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM3). The initial adjustment of the atmospheric circulation is characterized by an out-of-phase relationship between geopotential height anomalies in the lower and upper troposphere localized to the vicinity of the forcing. This initial baroclinic response reaches a maximum amplitude in similar to 5-10 days, and persists for 2-3 weeks. Diagnostic results with a linear primitive equation model indicate that this initial response is forced by diabatic heating anomalies in the lower troposphere associated with surface heat flux anomalies generated by the imposed thermal forcing. Following the initial baroclinic stage of adjustment, the response becomes progressively more barotropic and increases in both spatial extent and magnitude. The equilibrium stage of adjustment is reached in 2-2.5 months, and is characterized by an equivalent barotropic structure that resembles the hemispheric North Atlantic Oscillation-Northern Annular Mode (NAO-NAM) pattern, the model's leading internal mode of circulation variability over the Northern Hemisphere. The maximum amplitude of the equilibrium response is approximately 2-3 times larger than that of the initial response. The equilibrium response is primarily maintained by nonlinear transient eddy fluxes of vorticity (and, to a lesser extent, heat), with diabatic heating making a limited contribution in the vicinity of the forcing.},

	abstract = {In the Antarctic, dense shelf water is formed in coastal polynyas and is differentiated from the fresher surface water by the wind-induced ice motion that displaces offshore the ice melt from production zones. Where the shelf water discharges into the deep ocean, the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) is V shaped, separating the shelf and surface waters (referred to as "frontal" waters) from the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). To elucidate basic constraints on frontal properties, a minimal model of homogeneous water masses forced by offshore wind and freshwater input in a perpetual winter is considered. With the surface water stirred by-and hence aligned with-the ice cover, there is little leakage of ice or meltwater from the frontal system, so ice production and melt merely redistribute heat and salt between frontal waters. As such, the heat loss to the atmosphere needs to be supplied by entraining CDW, which then necessitates the shelf water discharge on account of the mass balance. Because of the freshwater input, the discharged shelf water may not be saltier than the CDW, which thus may descend the slope to form bottom water only because of its coldness. With both frontal waters cooled to the freezing point, dominant balances are formulated to determine their salinity and exchange rate with the ambient CDW. Although extremely crude, the model derivations are favorably compared with observations, which thus may provide physically based parameterizations for the bottom-water formation that can be incorporated into global models.},

	abstract = {[1] Tidewater glacier retreat is abrupt and typically irreversible. The mechanics of abrupt onset are evaluated by considering the behavior of a sliding law that depends inversely upon effective pressure ( p(ice) - p(water)); for such a law, flux can increase with decreasing thickness if the loss of bed traction exceeds the loss of driving stress. Characteristic values of increased flux and glacier thinning are shown to propagate upstream if ice flux increases with decreasing thickness below an ice thickness threshold determined by the chosen sliding law. Upstream propagation leads to instability, described in earlier literature, in which increased flow leads to thinning, loss of bed traction, and continued acceleration. In simplest terms, the instability arises when alterations in glacier geometry act to reduce resistive stresses more than driving stresses. The effects of diffusion are also analyzed, and it is shown that for the form of sliding law considered here, diffusion will not necessarily eliminate upstream-propagating instabilities. Application of this theory shows that a transition from stable to unstable conditions occurred at Columbia Glacier, Alaska, near the time of onset of its retreat in the early 1980s. The theory also successfully predicts stable or rapidly retreating states for 12 other Alaska tidewater glaciers, and its applicability to Greenland outlet glaciers is discussed.},

	abstract = {This study initiates the application of the maturing Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to the polar regions in the context of the real-time Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS). The behavior of the Advanced Research WRF (ARW) in a high-latitude setting and its ability to capture a significant Antarctic weather event are investigated. Also, in a suite of sensitivity tests, the impacts of the assimilation of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospheric motion vectors on ARW Antarctic forecasts are explored. The simulation results are analyzed and the statistical significance of error differences is assessed. It is found that with the proper consideration of MODIS data the ARW can accurately simulate a major Antarctic event, the May 2004 McMurdo windstorm. The ARW simulations illuminate an episode of high-momentum flow responding to the complex orography of the vital Ross Island region. While the model captures the synoptic setting and basic trajectory of the cyclone driving the event, there are differences on the mesoscale in the evolution of the low pressure system that significantly affect the forecast results. In general, both the ARW and AMPS's fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) tend to underforecast the wind magnitudes, reflecting their stalling and filling of the system near Ross Island. It is seen, however, that both targeted data assimilation and grid resolution enhancement can yield improvement in the forecast of the key parameter of wind speed. It is found that the assimilation of MODIS observations can significantly improve the forecast for a high-impact Antarctic weather event. However, the application to the retrievals of a filter accounting for instrument channel, observation height, and surface type is necessary. The results indicate benefits to initial conditions and high-resolution, polar, mesoscale forecasts from the careful assimilation of nontraditional satellite observations over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.},

	abstract = {The ice sheet-ice shelf transition zone plays an important role in controlling marine ice sheet dynamics, as it determines the rate at which ice flows out of the grounded part of the ice sheet. Together with accumulation, this outflow is the main control on the mass balance of the grounded sheet. In this paper, we verify the results of a boundary layer theory for ice flux in the transition zone against numerical solutions that are able to resolve the transition zone. Very close agreement is obtained, and grid refinement in the transition zone is identified as a critical component in obtaining reliable numerical results. The boundary layer theory confirms that ice flux through the grounding line in a two- dimensional sheet- shelf system increases sharply with ice thickness at the grounding line. This result is then applied to the large- scale dynamics of a marine ice sheet. Our principal results are that ( 1) marine ice sheets do not exhibit neutral equilibrium but have well- defined, discrete equilibrium profiles; ( 2) steady grounding lines cannot be stable on reverse bed slopes; and ( 3) marine ice sheets with overdeepened beds can undergo hysteresis under variations in sea level, accumulation rate, basal slipperiness, and ice viscosity. This hysteretic behavior can in principle explain the retreat of the West Antarctic ice sheet following the Last Glacial Maximum and may play a role in the dynamics of Heinrich events.},

	doi = {10.1029/2006JD008230},
	abstract = {[1] This paper synthesizes a variety of atmospheric and oceanic data to examine the large-scale energy budget of the Arctic. Assessment of the atmospheric budget relies primarily on the ERA-40 reanalysis. The seasonal cycles of vertically integrated atmospheric energy storage and the convergence of energy transport from ERA-40, as evaluated for the polar cap ( defined by the 70 degrees N latitude circle), in general compare well with realizations from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis over the period 1979 - 2001. However, shortcomings in top of atmosphere radiation, as compared to satellite data, and the net surface flux, contribute to large energy budget residuals in ERA-40. The seasonal cycle of atmospheric energy storage is strongly modulated by the net surface flux, which is also the primary driver of seasonal changes in heat storage within the Arctic Ocean. Averaged for an Arctic Ocean domain, the July net surface flux from ERA-40 of -100 W m(-2) (i.e., into the ocean), associated with sea ice melt and oceanic sensible heat gain, exceeds the atmospheric energy transport convergence of 91 W m(-2). During winter ( for which budget residuals are large), oceanic sensible heat loss and sea ice growth yield an upward surface flux of 50 - 60 W m(-2), complemented with an atmospheric energy convergence of 80 - 90 W m(-2) to provide a net radiation loss to space of 175 - 180 W m(-2).},

Two seven year long time slices, with high and low sea ice cover, were analyzed with respect to the feedbacks between the time-mean flow, the quasi-stationary planetary and the baroclinic waves. The wave energy fluxes on time scales of 2 to 6 days increase in the middle troposphere between 30 and 60 degrees N during the high sea ice phase and increase the zonal wind. This increase is compensated by a strong reduction in the Eliassen-Palm fluxes on time scales from 10 to 90 days between 60 and 70 degrees N during high sea ice phases, accompanied by reduced zonal winds. High sea ice cover phases are related to the zonal wind changes during the positive phases of the AO, especially over the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean.},

While the various observational sources used for validation contain differences among themselves, some model biases and across-model differences emerge. For all energy budget components in the twentieth-century simulations (the 20C3M simulation), the across-model variance and the differences from observational estimates are largest in the marginal ice zone (Barents, Kara, Chukchi Seas). Both downward and upward longwave radiation at the surface are underestimated in winter by many models, and the ensenmble mean annual net surface energy loss by longwave radiation is 35 W/m2, which is less than for the NCEP and ERA40 reanalyses but in line with some of the satellite estimates. Incoming solar radiation is overestimated by the models in spring and underestimated in summer and autumn. The ensemble mean annual net surface energy gain by shortwave radiation is 39 W/m2, which is slightly less than for the observational based estimates, In the twentyfirst-century simulations driven by the SRES A2 scenario, increased concentrations of greenhouse gasses increase (average for 2080–2100 minus average for 1980–2000 averages) the annual average ensemble mean downward longwave radiation by 30.1 W/m2. This was partly counteracted by a 10.7 W/m2 reduction in downward shortwave radiation. Enhanced sea ice melt and increased surface temperatures increase the annual surface upward longwave radiation by 27.1 W/m2 and reduce the upward shortwave radiation by 13.2 W/m2, giving an annual net (shortwave plus longwave) surface radiation increase of 5.8 W/m2 , with the maximum changes in summer. The increase in net surface radiation is largely offset by an increased energy loss of 4.4 W/m2 by the turbulent fluxes.},

	abstract = {[1] On the basis of simulations of hurricane Katrina in August 2005 with the advanced Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model at 4 km resolution without parameterized convection, empirical relationships are computed between the maximum simulated wind and the surface fluxes and precipitation and provide a reasonable fit to the data. The best track data set of global observed tropical cyclones is used to estimate the frequency that storms of a given strength occur over the globe after 1970. For 1990-2005 the total surface heat loss by the tropical ocean in hurricanes category 1 to 5 within 400 km of the center of the storms is estimated to be about 0.53 x 10(22) J a(-1) (where a is year) (0.17 PW). The enthalpy loss due to hurricanes computed on the basis of precipitation is about a factor of 3.4 greater (0.58 PW), owing to the addition of the surface fluxes from outside 400 km radius and moisture convergence into the storms typically from as far from the eye as 1600 km. Globally these values correspond to 0.33 W m(-2) for evaporation, or 1.13 W m(-2) for precipitation. Changes over time reflect basin differences and a prominent role for El Ni (n) over tildeo, and the most active period globally was 1989 to 1997. Strong positive trends from 1970 to 2005 occur in these inferred surface fluxes and precipitation arising from increases in intensity of storms and also higher sea surface temperatures. Confidence in this result is limited by uncertainties in the best track tropical cyclone data. Nonetheless, the results highlight the importance of surface energy exchanges in global energetics of the climate system and are suggestive of the deficiencies in climate models owing to their inadequate representation of hurricanes.},

	abstract = {The radiative feedback from clouds remains the largest source of variation in climate sensitivity amongst general circulation models (GCMs). A cloud clustering methodology is applied to six contemporary GCMs in order to provide a detailed intercomparison and evaluation of the simulated cloud regimes. By analysing GCMs in the context of cloud regimes, processes related to particular cloud types are more likely to be evaluated. In this paper, the mean properties of the global cloud regimes are evaluated, and the cloud response to climate change is analysed in the cloud-regime framework. Most of the GCMs are able to simulate the principal cloud regimes, however none of the models analysed have a good representation of trade cumulus in the tropics. The models also share a difficulty in simulating those regimes with cloud tops at mid-levels, with only ECHAM5 producing a regime of tropical cumulus congestus. Optically thick, high top cloud in the extra-tropics, typically associated with the passage of frontal systems, is simulated considerably too frequently in the ECHAM5 model. This appears to be a result of the cloud type persisting in the model after the meteorological conditions associated with frontal systems have ceased. The simulation of stratocumulus in the MIROC GCMs is too extensive, resulting in the tropics being too reflective. Most of the global-mean cloud response to doubled CO2 in the GCMs is found to be a result of changes in the cloud radiative properties of the regimes, rather than changes in the relative frequency of occurrence (RFO) of the regimes. Most of the variance in the global cloud response between the GCMs arises from differences in the radiative response of frontal cloud in the extra-tropics and from stratocumulus cloud in the tropics. This variance is largely the result of excessively high RFOs of specific regimes in particular GCMs. It is shown here that evaluation and subsequent improvement in the simulation of the present-day regime properties has the potential to reduce the variance of the global cloud response, and hence climate sensitivity, amongst GCMs. For the ensemble of models considered in this study, the use of observations of the mean present-day cloud regimes suggests a potential reduction in the range of climate sensitivity of almost a third.},

	abstract = {Outputs from simulations performed with current atmosphere-ocean general circulation models for the Fourth Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4) are used to investigate the evolution of sea ice over the 20th and 21st centuries. We first use the results from the "Climate of the 20th Century Experiment" to assess the ability of these models to reproduce the observed sea ice cover changes over the periods 1981-2000 and 1951-2000. The projected sea ice changes over the 21st century in response to the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios A I B are then examined. Overall, there is a large uncertainty in simulating the present-day sea ice coverage and thickness and in predicting sea ice changes in both hemispheres. Over the period 1981-2000, we find that the multimodel average sea ice extent agrees reasonably well with observations in both hemipsheres despite the wide differences between the models. The largest uncertainties appear in the Southern Hemisphere. The climate change projections over the 21st century reveal that the annual mean sea ice extent decreases at similar rates in both hemispheres, and that the reduction in annual mean sea ice volume is about twice that of sea ice extent reduction in the Northern Hemisphere, in agreement with earlier studies. We show that the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of sea ice extent increases in both hemispheres in a warming climate, with a larger magnitude in the Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, it appears that the seasonal cycle of ice extent is more affected than the one of ice volume. By the end of the 21st century, half of the model population displays an ice-free Arctic Ocean in late summer. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

All available SMB observations from Antarctica (N = 1900) are used for the comparison, except clearly erroneous observations and data which are in areas where dominant SMB patterns occur on scales smaller than the model resolution. A high correlation is found (r = 0.82), while the regression slope (1.2) indicates that the model slightly overemphasizes SMB gradients. Comparing the model SMB with the latest SMB compilation, a similarly high correlation is found (r = 0.79), but the regression slope is much too steep because model-simulated SMB agrees less with the compilation in data-sparse regions. Model-simulated SMB resembles the observed SMB as a function of elevation very well. This is used to calibrate model-simulated SMB to reassess the contemporary Antarctic SMB. Compared to the latest SMB compilation, calibrated model-simulated SMB is up to 1 m yr(-1) higher in the coastal zones of East and West Antarctica, which are without exception in areas with few observations. As a result, the SMB integrated over the grounded ice sheet (171 +/- 3 mm yr(-1)) exceeds previous estimates by as much as 15\%. Support or falsification of this model result can only be found in new SMB observations from high accumulation regions.},

Negative ice anomalies in these years are prevalent in the peripheral seas but are most dominant in the eastern Arctic basin where the perennial ice becomes even more vulnerable to further decline. Overall, the winter ice anomalies correlate well with surface temperature anomalies and wind circulation patterns. Since historical satellite data indicate a positive trend in winter temperatures and a negative trend in the length of seasonal ice growth period, it is likely that the winter ice cover will continue to retreat in the near future.

However, the added value provided by such models is not well explored so far, and claims have been made that RCMs have little utility. Here, it is demonstrated that RCMs are indeed returning significant added value. Employing appropriate spatial filters, the scale-dependent skill of a state-of-the-art RCM ( with and without nudging of large scales) is examined by comparing its skill with that of the global reanalyses driving the RCM. This skill is measured by pattern correlation coefficients of the global reanalyses or the RCM simulation and, as a reference, of an operational regional weather analysis. For the spatially smooth variable air pressure the RCM improves this aspect of the simulation for the medium scales if the RCM is driven with large-scale constraints, but not for the large scales. For the regionally more structured quantity near-surface temperature the added value is more obvious. The simulation of medium-scale 2-m temperature anomaly fields amounts to an increase of the mean pattern correlation coefficient up to 30\%.},

	title = {Do changes in the midlatitude circulation have any impact on the {Arctic} surface air temperature trend?},
	volume = {19},
	doi = {10.1175/JCLI3906.1},
	abstract = {The warming of the near-surface air in the Arctic region has been larger than the global mean surface warming. There is general agreement that the Arctic amplification of the surface air temperature (SAT) trend to a considerable extent is due to local effects such as the retreat of sea ice, especially during the summer months, and earlier melting of snow in the spring season. There is no doubt that these processes are important causes of the Arctic SAT trend. It is less clear, however, whether the trend may also be related to recent changes in the atmospheric midlatitude circulation. This question is the focus of the present paper.Model experiments have shown that in a warmer climate responding to, for example, a doubling of CO2, the atmospheric northward energy transport (ANET) will increase and cause polar SAT amplification. In the present study, the development of the ANET across 60 degrees N and its linkage to the Arctic SAT have been explored using the ERA-40 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It is found that during 1979-2001, the ANET has experienced an overall positive but weak trend, which was largest during the period from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. In addition, it is found that the Arctic SAT is sensitive to variability of the ANET across 60 degrees N and hence to variability of the midlatitude circulation: A large ANET is followed by warming of the Arctic where ANET leads by about 5 days. The warming is located primarily north of the Atlantic and Pacific sectors, indicating that baroclinic weather systems developing around the Icelandic and Aleutian lows are important for the energy transport. Furthermore, it is suggested here that a small, but statistically significant, part of the mean Arctic SAT trend is linked to the trend in the ANET.Another important indicator of the midlatitude circulation is the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Through the 1980s and early 1990s the AO index has shown a positive trend. However, even though a part of the SAT trend can be related to the AO in localized parts of the Arctic area, the mean Arctic SAT trend shows no significant linkage to the AO.},

	abstract = {The sea ice simulation of the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) T42-gx1 and T85-gx1 control simulations is presented and the influence of the parameterized sea ice thickness distribution (ITD) on polar climate conditions is examined. This includes an analysis of the change in mean climate conditions and simulated sea ice feedbacks when an ITD is included. It is found that including a representation of the subgrid-scale ITD results in larger ice growth rates and thicker sea ice. These larger growth rates represent a higher heat loss from the ocean ice column to the atmosphere, resulting in warmer surface conditions. Ocean circulation, most notably in the Southern Hemisphere, is also modified by the ITD because of the influence of enhanced high-latitude ice formation on the ocean buoyancy flux and resulting deep water formation. Changes in atmospheric circulation also result, again most notably in the Southern Hemisphere.There are indications that the ITD also modifies simulated sea ice-related feedbacks. In regions of similar ice thickness, the surface albedo changes at 2 X CO2 conditions are larger when an ITD is included, suggesting an enhanced surface albedo feedback. The presence of an ITD also modifies the ice thickness-ice strength relationship and the ice thickness-ice growth rate relationship, both of which represent negative feedbacks on ice thickness. The net influence of the ITD on polar climate sensitivity and variability results from the interaction of these and other complex feedback processes.},

The assessment shows that the sea ice/SST forcing has an impact on the atmospheric simulations. The near-surface air temperature response shows a strong, seasonally dependent sensitivity to sea ice changes. The response is small in summer but significant in winter, and changes in the marginal ice zone have the largest impact on the atmosphere. During winter, the realistic representation of the marginal sea ice zone is important as it contributes to the simulation of regional atmospheric circulation patterns and temperature profiles. Changes in sea ice thickness of the western Arctic lower boundary indicate an Arctic-wide response in the large-scale circulation and seem to have an impact on the troposphere-stratosphere coupling. During summer the direct thermodynamic effect of sea ice changes is small, while the dynamic response is still of importance but smaller than in winter.},

Observations document recent warming, but an enhanced Arctic Ocean signal is not readily evident. This disparity, combined with varying model projections of SAT change, and large variability in observed SAT over the 20th century, may lead one to question the concept of Arctic amplification. Disparity is greatly reduced, however, if one compares observed trajectories to near-future simulations (2010-2029), rather than to the doubled-CO2 or late 21st century conditions that are typically cited. These near-future simulations document a preconditioning phase of Arctic amplification, characterized by the initial retreat and thinning of sea ice, with imprints of low-frequency variability. Observations show these same basic features, but with SATs over the Arctic Ocean still largely constrained by the insulating effects of the ice cover and thermal inertia of the upper ocean. Given the general consistency with model projections, we are likely near the threshold when absorption of solar radiation during summer limits ice growth the following autumn and winter, initiating a feedback leading to a substantial increase in Arctic Ocean SATs.},

	abstract = {[ 1] This paper synthesizes our understanding of the Arctic's large-scale freshwater cycle. It combines terrestrial and oceanic observations with insights gained from the ERA-40 reanalysis and land surface and ice-ocean models. Annual mean freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean is dominated by river discharge (38\%), inflow through Bering Strait (30\%), and net precipitation (24\%). Total freshwater export from the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic is dominated by transports through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (35\%) and via Fram Strait as liquid (26\%) and sea ice (25\%). All terms are computed relative to a reference salinity of 34.8. Compared to earlier estimates, our budget features larger import of freshwater through Bering Strait and larger liquid phase export through Fram Strait. While there is no reason to expect a steady state, error analysis indicates that the difference between annual mean oceanic inflows and outflows ( similar to 8\% of the total inflow) is indistinguishable from zero. Freshwater in the Arctic Ocean has a mean residence time of about a decade. This is understood in that annual freshwater input, while large ( similar to 8500 km(3)), is an order of magnitude smaller than oceanic freshwater storage of similar to 84,000 km(3). Freshwater in the atmosphere, as water vapor, has a residence time of about a week. Seasonality in Arctic Ocean freshwater storage is nevertheless highly uncertain, reflecting both sparse hydrographic data and insufficient information on sea ice volume. Uncertainties mask seasonal storage changes forced by freshwater fluxes. Of flux terms with sufficient data for analysis, Fram Strait ice outflow shows the largest interannual variability.},

	doi = {10.1175/JCLI3649.1},
	abstract = {A steady decline in Arctic sea ice has been observed over recent decades. General circulation models predict further decreases under increasing greenhouse gas scenarios. Sea ice plays an important role in the climate system in that it influences ocean-to-atmosphere fluxes, surface albedo, and ocean buoyancy. The aim Of this Study is to isolate the climate impacts of a declining Arctic sea ice cover during the current century. The Hadley Centre Atmospheric Model (HadAM3) is forced with observed sea ice from 1980 to 2000 (obtained from satellite passive microwave radiometer data derived with the Bootstrap algorithm) and predicted sea ice reductions until 2100 under one moderate scenario and one severe scenario of ice decline, with a climatological SST field and increasing SSTs. Significant warming of the Arctic occurs during the twenty-first century (mean increase of between 1.6 degrees and 3.9 degrees C), with positive anomalies of up to 22 degrees C locally. The majority of this is over ocean and limited to high latitudes. in contrast to recent observations of Northern Hemisphere warming. When a climatological SST field is used, statistically significant impacts on climate are only seen in winter, despite prescribing sea ice reductions in all months. When correspondingly increasing SSTs are incorporated, changes in climate are seen in both winter and summer, although the impacts in summer are much smaller. Alterations in atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns are more widespread than temperature, extending down to midlatitude storm tracks. Results suggest that areas of Arctic land ice may even undergo net accumulation due to increased precipitation that results from loss of sea ice. Intensification of storm tracks implies that parts of Europe may experience higher precipitation rates.},

	abstract = {The sea ice simulations by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) models for the climate of the twentieth century and for global warming scenarios have been synthesized. A large number of model simulations realistically captured the climatological annual mean, seasonal cycle, and temporal trends of sea ice area over the Northern Hemisphere during 1979-99, although there is considerable scatter among the models. In particular, multimodel ensemble means show promising estimates very close to observations for the late twentieth century. Model projections for the twenty-first century demonstrate the largest sea ice area decreases generally in the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B and A2 scenarios compared with the B1 scenario, indicating large multimodel ensemble mean reductions of -3.54 +/- 1.66 X 10(5) km(2) decade(-1) in A1B, -4.08 +/- 1.33 X 10(5) km(2) decade(-1) in A2, and -2.22 +/- 1.11 X 10(5) km(2) decade(-1) in B1. The corresponding percentage reductions are 31.1\%, 33.4\%, and 21.6\% in the last 20 yr of the twenty-first century, relative to 1979-99. Furthermore, multiyear ice coverage decreases rapidly at rates of -3.86 +/- 2.07 X 10(5) km(2) decade(-1) in A1B, -4.94 +/- 1.91 X 10(5) km(2) decade(-1) in A2, and -2.67 +/- 1.7107 X 10(5) km(2) decade(-1) in B1, making major contributions to the total ice reductions. In contrast, seasonal (first year) ice area increases by 1.10 +/- 2.46 X 10(5) km(2) decade(-1), 1.99 +/- 1.47 X 10(5) km(2) decade(-1), and 1.05 +/- 1.9247 X 10(5) km(5) decade(-1) in the same scenarios, leading to decreases of 59.7\%, 65.0\%, and 45.8\% of the multiyear ice area, and increases of 14.1\%, 27.8\%, and 11.2\% of the seasonal ice area in the last 20 yr of this century. Statistical analysis shows that many of the models are consistent in the sea ice change projections among all scenarios. The results include an evaluation of the 99\% confidence interval of the model-derived change of sea ice coverage, giving a quantification of uncertainties in estimating sea ice changes based on the participating models. Hence, the seasonal cycle of sea ice area is amplified and an increased large portion of seasonally ice-covered Arctic Ocean is expected at the end of the twenty-first century. The very different changes of multiyear and seasonal ice may have significant implications for the polar energy and hydrological budgets and pathways.},

	abstract = {Hudson Bay experiences a complete cryogenic cycle each year. Sea ice begins to form in late October, and the Bay is usually ice-free in early August. This seasonally varying ice cover plays an important role in the regional climate. To identify secular trends in the cryogenic cycle, we examined variability in the timing of sea-ice formation and retreat during the period 1971—2003. The dates of ice freeze-up and breakup at 36 locations across Hudson Bay were catalogued for each year from weekly ice charts provided by the Canadian Ice Service. We used the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test to determine the statistical significance of the trends and the Theil-Sen approach to estimate their magnitude. Our results indicate statistically significant trends toward earlier breakup in James Bay, along the southern shore of Hudson Bay, and in the western half of Hudson Bay, and toward later freeze-up in the northern and northeastern regions of Hudson Bay. These trends in the annual ice cycle of Hudson Bay coincide with both the regional temperature record and the projections from general circulation models. If this trend toward a longer ice-free season continues, Hudson Bay will soon face important environmental challenges. /// Chaque année, la Baie d'Hudson connaît un cycle cryogénique complet. La formation de la glace marine commence en fin d'octobre et la baie est habituellement exempte de glace en début d'août. La présence saisonnière du couvert de la glace de la Baie d'Hudson revêt une importance primordiale sur le climat régional. Dans cet article, on étudie la variabilité des dates de formation et de retrait de la glace marine de la Baie d'Hudson dans le but d'identifier des tendances séculaires durant la période 1971 à 2003. Les dates de formation et de retrait de la glace marine ont été cataloguées pour tous les ans dans le cas de 36 endroits à travers la Baie d'Hudson et la Baie James en utilisant des images hebdomadaires publiées par le Service canadien des glaces. Le test non paramétrique Mann Kendall a été utilisé pour déterminer la signification statistique des tendances alors que la méthode de Theil Sen nous a fourni un estimé de l'ampleur de ces mêmes tendances. Notre analyse statistique nous indique qu'il existe des tendances significatives vers une date de déglacement plus avancée dans la Baie James, le long de la côte sud de la Baie d'Hudson, et dans la partie ouest de la Baie d' Hudson. De plus, des tendances significatives vers un gel plus tardif ont été observées dans les régions du nord et du nord-est de la Baie d'Hudson. Ces tendances dans le cycle annuel de glace de la Baie d'Hudson coïncident avec les tendances des températures de la région de même qu'avec les projections des modèles de circulation générale. Si cette tendance vers une durée plus courte du couvert de glace continue, la région de la Baie d'Hudson relèvera des défis environnementaux importants dans un proche avenir.},

	abstract = {Recent snow accumulation rate is a key quantity for ice-core and mass-balance studies. Several accumulation measurement methods (stake farm, fin core, snow-radar profiling, surface morphology, remote sensing) were used, compared and integrated at eight sites along a transect from Terra Nova Bay to Dome C, East Antarctica, to provide information about the spatial and temporal variability of snow accumulation. Thirty-nine cores were dated by identifying tritium/β marker levels (1965-66) and non-sea-salt (nss) SO42- spikes of the Tambora (Indonesia) volcanic event (1816) in order to provide information on temporal variability. Cores were linked by snow radar and global positioning system surveys to provide detailed information on spatial variability in snow accumulation. Stake-farm and ice-core accumulation rates are observed to differ significantly, but isochrones (snow radar) correlate well with ice-core derived accumulation. The accumulation/ablation pattern from stake measurements suggests that the annual local noise (metre scale) in snow accumulation can approach 2 years of ablation and more than four times the average annual accumulation, with no accumulation or ablation for a 5 year period in up to 40\% of cases. The spatial variability of snow accumulation at the kilometre scale is one order of magnitude higher than temporal variability at the multi-decadal/secular scale. Stake measurements and firn cores at Dome C confirm an approximate 30\% increase in accumulation over the last two centuries, with respect to the average over the last 5000 years.},

	abstract = {The observations of the ocean-atmosphere-sea ice have recently revealed that the oceanic surfaces can have a subtle but significant impact on the atmospheric long-term fluctuations. Low-frequency variations and long-term trends of the North Atlantic atmospheric circulation have been partly related to particular SST and sea ice features. In this work, the influence of typical tripolar SST and dipolar sea ice anomalies in the North Atlantic-Arctic on the atmosphere is investigated. A large ensemble of AGCM simulations forced by three different anomalous boundary conditions (SST, sea ice, and SST + sea ice) are used. The linearity of the simulated response in the winter season is particularly assessed.In these experiments, while the winter low-level temperature response is mainly symmetric about the sign of the forcing, the asymmetric part of the geopotential response is substantial. The sea ice forcing maintains a baroclinic response with a strong temperature anomaly in the vicinity of the forcing but with a weak vertical penetration. The SST maintains an NAO-like equivalent barotropic temperature and geopotential height response that extends throughout the troposphere. It is also shown that the combination of the two forcings is mainly linear for the low-level temperature and nonlinear for the geopotential height. While the SST forcing seems to be the main contributor to the total temperature and geopotential height responses, the sea ice forcing appears to introduce significant nonlinear perturbations.},

The filter is simple in the construction and easy to apply while giving reasonable results. The method allows for considerable flexibility in choosing this specific response. This way, low-, band-, and high-pass filters are obtained.

	abstract = {Empirical angular distribution models for estimating top-of-atmosphere shortwave irradiances from radiance measurements over permanent snow, fresh snow, and sea ice are developed using CERES measurements on Terra. Permanent snow angular distribution models depend on cloud fraction, cloud optical thickness, and snow brightness. Fresh snow and sea ice angular distribution models depend on snow and sea ice fraction, cloud fraction, cloud optical thickness, and snow and ice brightness. These classifications lead to 10 scene types for permanent snow and 25 scene types for fresh snow and sea ice. The average radiance over clear-sky permanent snow is more isotropic with satellite viewing geometry than that over overcast permanent snow. On average, the albedo of clear-sky permanent snow varies from 0.65 to 0.68 for solar zenith angles between 60 degrees and 80 degrees, while the corresponding albedo of overcast scenes varies from 0.70 to 0.73. Clear-sky permanent snow albedos over Antarctica estimated from two independent angular distribution models are consistent to within 0.6\%, on average. Despite significant variability in sea ice optical properties with season, the estimated mean relative albedo error is -1.0\% for very dark sea ice and 0.1\% for very bright sea ice when albedos derived from different viewing angles are averaged. The estimated regional root-mean-square (RMS) relative albedo error is 5.6\% and 2.6\% when the sea ice angular distribution models are applied to a region that contains very dark and very bright sea ice, respectively. Similarly, the estimated relative albedo bias error for fresh snow is -0.1\% for very dark snow scenes and 0.1\% for very bright snow scenes. The estimated regional RMS relative albedo error is 3.5\% and 5.0\% when angular distribution models are applied to a region that contains very dark and very bright fresh snow, respectively. These error estimates are only due to angular distribution model error and do not include the error caused by scene identification.},

The total solar irradiance (TSI) from the TIM is about 1361 W/m(2), or 4-5 W/m(2) lower than that measured by other current TSI instruments. This difference is not considered an instrument or calibration error. Comparisons with other instruments show excellent agreement of solar variability on a relative scale. The TIM observed the Sun during the extreme activity period extending from late October to early November 2003. During this period, the instrument recorded both the largest short-term decrease in the 25-year TSI record and also the first definitive detection of a solar flare in TSI, from which an integrated energy of roughly (6 +/- 3)x10(32) stop ergs from the 28 October 2003 X17 flare is estimated.

	abstract = {The Arctic plays a major role in the global circulation, and its water and energy budget is not as well explored as that in other regions of the world. The aim of this study is to calculate the climatological mean water and energy fluxes depending on the season and on the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) through the lower, lateral, and upper boundaries of the Arctic atmosphere north of 70 degrees N. The relevant fluxes are derived from results of the regional climate model (REMO 5.1), which is applied to the Arctic region for the time period 1979-2000. Model forcing data are a combination of 15-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-15) data and analysis data. The annual and seasonal total water and energy fluxes derived from REMO 5.1 results are very similar to the fluxes calculated from observational and reanalysis data, although there are some differences in the components. The agreement between simulated and observed total fluxes shows that these fluxes are reliable. Even if differences between high and low NAO situations occur in our simulation consistent with previous studies, these differences are mostly smaller than the large uncertainties due to a small sample size of the NAO high and low composites.},

A previous sensitivity study utilizing the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s (NCAR) atmospheric general circulation model [AGCM; Community Climate Model, version 3 (CCM3)] to explore climate sensitivity to declining Arctic sea ice cover suggested that, as Arctic sea ice cover is reduced, precipitation patterns over western North America will shift toward dryer conditions in southwestern North America and wetter conditions in northwestern North America. Here, three complementary lines of research validate and explore the robustness of this possible climate change impact: 1) repetition of the previous sensitivity study (specified constant Arctic sea ice cover and atmospheric CO2) with an updated version of the NCAR AGCM [third Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3)], 2) investigation of the climate response to dynamically reduced Arctic sea ice cover (driven by a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2) in the coupled NCAR Community Climate System Model (CCSMv3), and 3) analysis of similar results from six other coupled climate system models. Results from the CAM3 sensitivity study are similar to those from the original study with declining Arctic sea ice cover driving up to 25\% less mean annual precipitation (MAP) over southwestern North America and up to an 8\% increase in MAP over northwestern North America. The seven coupled models also reproduce this same general pattern. At the time of CO2 quadrupling, Arctic sea ice cover is reduced (up to 90\% in boreal winter) and MAP over southwestern North America decreases by up to 30\% while MAP in northwestern North America increases by up to 40\%. These results represent a significant shift in the precipitation pattern over western North America and support the findings of the original sensitivity study in suggesting that, as future reductions in Arctic sea ice cover take place, there will be a substantial impact on water resources in western North America.},

	abstract = {There are significant discrepancies between observational datasets of Arctic sea ice concentrations covering the last three decades, which result in differences of over 20\% in Arctic summer sea ice extent/area and 5\%-10\% in winter. Previous modeling studies have shown that idealized sea ice anomalies have the potential for making a substantial impact on climate. In this paper, this theory is further developed by performing a set of simulations using the third Hadley Centre Coupled Atmospheric Model (HadAM3). The model was driven with monthly climatologies of sea ice fractions derived from three of these records to investigate potential implications of sea ice inaccuracies for climate simulations. The standard sea ice climatology from the Met Office provided a control. This study focuses on the effects of actual inaccuracies of concentration retrievals, which vary spatially and are larger in summer than winter.The smaller sea ice discrepancies in winter have a much larger influence on climate than the much greater summer sea ice differences. High sensitivity to sea ice prescription was observed, even though no SST feedbacks were included. Significant effects on surface fields were observed in the Arctic, North Atlantic, and North Pacific. Arctic average surface air temperature anomalies in winter vary by 2.5 degrees C, and locally exceed 12 degrees C. Arctic mean sea level pressure varies by up to 5 mb locally. Anomalies extend to 45 degrees N over North America and Eurasia but not to lower latitudes, and with limited changes in circulation above the boundary layer. No statistically significant impact on climate variability was simulated, in terms of the North Atlantic Oscillation. Results suggest that the uncertainty in summer sea ice prescription is not critical but that winter values require greater accuracy, with the caveats that the influences of ocean-sea ice feedbacks were not included in this study.},

	abstract = {Abstract A primary climate change signal in the central Arctic is the melting of sea ice. This is dependent on the interplay between the atmosphere and the sea ice, which is critically dependent on the exchange of momentum, heat and moisture at the surface. In assessing the realism of climate change scenarios it is vital to know the quality by which these exchanges are modelled in climate simulations. Six state-of-the-art regional-climate models are run for one year in the western Arctic, on a common domain that encompasses the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment ice-drift track. Surface variables, surface fluxes and the vertical structure of the lower troposphere are evaluated using data from the SHEBA experiment. All the models are driven by the same lateral boundary conditions, sea-ice fraction and sea and sea-ice surface temperatures. Surface pressure, near-surface air temperature, specific humidity and wind speed agree well with observations, with a falling degree of accuracy in that order. Wind speeds have systematic biases in some models, by as much as a few metres per second. The surface radiation fluxes are also surprisingly accurate, given the complexity of the problem. The turbulent momentum flux is acceptable, on average, in most models, but the turbulent heat fluxes are, however, mostly unreliable. Their correlation with observed fluxes is, in principle, insignificant, and they accumulate over a year to values an order of magnitude larger than observed. Typical instantaneous errors are easily of the same order of magnitude as the observed net atmospheric heat flux. In the light of the sensitivity of the atmosphere–ice interaction to errors in these fluxes, the ice-melt in climate change scenarios must be viewed with considerable caution.},

	abstract = {Using the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) for 1958 to 2001, adjusted for bias over the southern oceans prior to 1.979, an analysis is made of global patterns of monthly mean anomalies of atmospheric mass, which is approximately conserved globally. It differs from previous analyses of atmospheric circulation by effectively area weighting surface or sea level pressure that diminishes the role of high latitudes. To examine whether global patterns of behavior exist requires analysis of all seasons together (as opposite seasons occur in each hemisphere). Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, R-mode varimax-rotated EOF analysis, and cyclostationary EOF (CSEOF) analysis tools are used to explore patterns and variability on interannual and longer time scales. Clarification is given of varimax terminology and procedures that have been previously misinterpreted. The dominant global monthly variability overall is associated with the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM), which is active in all months of the year. However, it is not very coherent from month to month and exhibits a great deal of natural unforced variability. The third most important pattern is the Northern Hemisphere annular mode (NAM) and associated North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which is the equivalent Northern Hemisphere expression. Neither of these is really a global mode, although they covary on long time scales in association with tropical or external forcing. For monthly data, the second mode is coherent with Nino-3.4 sea surface temperatures and thus corresponds to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is truly global in extent. It exhibits more coherent evolution with time and projects strongest onto the interannual variability, where it stands out by far as the dominant mode in the CSEOF analysis. The CSEOF analysis extracts the patterns phase locked with annual cycle and reveals their evolution throughout the year. Standard EOF and varimax analyses are not able to evolve with time of year unless the analysis is stratified by season. Varimax analysis is able to extract the SAM, NAM, and ENSO modes very well, however.},

	abstract = {An analysis and evaluation has been performed of global datasets on column-integrated water vapor (precipitable water). For years before 1996, the Ross and Elliott radiosonde dataset is used for validation of European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalyses ERA-40. Only the special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) dataset from remote sensing systems (RSS) has credible means, variability and trends for the oceans, but it is available only for the post-1988 period. Major problems are found in the means, variability and trends from 1988 to 2001 for both reanalyses from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the ERA-40 reanalysis over the oceans, and for the NASA water vapor project (NVAP) dataset more generally. NCEP and ERA-40 values are reasonable over land where constrained by radiosondes. Accordingly, users of these data should take great care in accepting results as real. The problems highlight the need for reprocessing of data, as has been done by RSS, and reanalyses that adequately take account of the changing observing system. Precipitable water variability for 1988-2001 is dominated by the evolution of ENSO and especially the structures that occurred during and following the 1997-98 El Nino event. The evidence from SSM/I for the global ocean suggests that recent trends in precipitable water are generally positive and, for 1988 through 2003, average 0.40 +/- 0.09 mm per decade or 1.3 +/- 0.3\% per decade for the ocean as a whole, where the error bars are 95\% confidence intervals. Over the oceans, the precipitable water variability relates very strongly to changes in SSTs, both in terms of spatial structure of trends and temporal variability (with regression coefficient for 30 degrees N-30 degrees S of 7.8\% K-1) and is consistent with the assumption of fairly constant relative humidity. In the tropics, the trends are also influenced by changes in rainfall which, in turn, are closely associated with the mean flow and convergence of moisture by the trade winds. The main region where positive trends are not very evident is over Europe, in spite of large and positive trends over the North Atlantic since 1988. A much longer time series is probably required to obtain stable patterns of trends over the oceans, although the main variability could probably be deduced from past SST and associated precipitation variations.},

	abstract = {ERA-40 is a re-analysis of meteorological observations from September 1957 to August 2002 produced by the European Centre for Mediumw-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in collaboration with many institutions. The observing system changed considerably over this re-analysis period, with assimilable data provided by a succession of satellite-borne instruments from the 1970s onwards, supplemented by increasing numbers of observations from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other surface platforms, but with a declining number of radiosonde ascents since the late 1980s. The observations used in ERA-40 were accumulated from many sources. The first part of this paper describes the data acquisition and the principal changes in data type and coverage over the period. It also describes the data assimilation system used for ERA-40. This benefited from many of the changes introduced into operational forecasting since the mid-1990s, when the systems used for the 15-year ECMWF re-analysis (ERA-15) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis were implemented. Several of the improvements are discussed. General aspects of the production of the analyses are also summarized. A number of results indicative of the overall performance of the data assimilation system, and implicitly of the observing system, are presented and discussed. The comparison of background (short-range) forecasts and analyses with observations, the consistency of the global mass budget, the magnitude of differences between analysis and background fields and the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from the ERA-40 analyses are illustrated. Several results demonstrate the marked improvement that was made to the observing system for the Southern hemisphere in the 1970s. particularly towards the end of the decade. In contrast. the synoptic quality of the analysis for the northern hemisphere is sufficient to provide forecasts that remain skilful well into the medium range for all years. Two particular problems are also examined: excessive precipitation over tropical oceans and a too strong Brewer-Dobson circulation, both of which are pronounced in later years. Several other aspects of the quality of the re-analyses revealed by monitoring and validation studies are summarized. Expectations that the 'second-generation' ERA-40 re-analysis would provide products that are better than those from the first generation ERA-15 and NCEP/NCAR re-analyses are found to have been met in most cases.},

	abstract = {Over the past 20 yr, some Arctic surface and cloud properties have changed significantly. Results of an analysis of satellite data show that the Arctic has warmed and become cloudier in spring and summer but has cooled and become less cloudy in winter. The annual rate of surface temperature change is 0.057°C for the Arctic region north of 60°N. The surface broadband albedo has decreased significantly in autumn, especially over the Arctic Ocean, indicating a later freeze-up and snowfall. The surface albedo has decreased at an annual rate of −0.15\% (absolute). Cloud fraction has decreased at an annual rate of −0.6\% (absolute) in winter and increased at annual rates of 0.32\% and 0.16\% in spring and summer, respectively. On an annual time scale, there is no trend in cloud fraction. During spring and summer, changes in sea ice albedo that result from surface warming tend to modulate the radiative effect of increasing cloud cover. On an annual time scale, the all-wave cloud forcing at the surface has decreased at an annual rate of –0.335 W m−2, indicating an increased cooling by clouds. There are large correlations between surface temperature anomalies and climate indices such as the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index for some areas, implying linkages between global climate change and Arctic climate change.},

	abstract = {Changes in active layer thickness (ALT) over northern high-latitude permafrost regions have important impacts on the surface energy balance, hydrologic cycle, carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface, plant growth, and ecosystems as a whole. This study examines the 20th century variations of ALT for the Ob, Yenisey, and Lena River basins. ALT is estimated from historical soil temperature measurements from 17 stations (1956–1990, Lena basin only), an annual thawing index based on both surface air temperature data (1901–2002) and numerical modeling (1980–2002). The latter two provide spatial fields. Based on the thawing index, the long-term average (1961–1990) ALT is about 1.87 m in the Ob, 1.67 in the Yenisey, and 1.69 m in the Lena basin. Over the past several decades, ALT over the three basins shows positive trends, but with different magnitudes. Based on the 17 stations, ALT increased about 0.32 m between 1956 and 1990 in the Lena. To the extent that results based on the soil temperatures represent ground “truth,” ALT obtained from both the thawing index and numerical modeling is underestimated. It is widely believed that ALT will increase with global warming. However, this hypothesis needs further refinement since ALT responds primarily to summer air temperature while observed warming has occurred mainly in winter and spring. It is also shown that ALT exhibits complex and inconsistent responses to variations in snow cover.},

	abstract = {The influence of realistic Arctic sea ice anomalies on the atmosphere during winter is investigated with version 3.6 of the Community Climate Model (CCM3.6). Model experiments are performed for the winters with the most (1982/83) and least (1995/96) Arctic ice coverage during 1979-99, when ice concentration estimates were available from satellites. The experiments consist of 50-member ensembles: using large ensembles proved critical to distinguish the signal from noise.The local response to ice anomalies over the subpolar seas of both the Atlantic and Pacific is robust and generally shallow with large upward surface heat fluxes ({\textgreater}100 W m(-2)), near-surface warming, enhanced precipitation, and below-normal sea level pressure where sea ice receded, and the reverse where the ice expanded. The large-scale response to reduced (enhanced) ice extent to the east (west) of Greenland during 1982/83 resembles the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) with a ridge over the poles and a trough at midlatitudes. The large-scale response was distinctly different in the Pacific, where ice extent anomalies in the Sea of Okhotsk generate a wave train that extends downstream over North America but the wave train response is greatly diminished when the model is driven by ice concentration rather than ice extent anomalies. Comparing the AGCM response to observations suggests that the feedback of the ice upon the atmospheric circulation is positive (negative) in the Pacific (Atlantic) sector. The magnitude of the wintertime response to ice extent anomalies is modest, on the order of 20 m at 500 mb. However, the 500-mb height anomalies roughly double in strength over much of the Arctic when forced by ice concetration anomalies. Furthermore, the NAO-like response increases linearly with the aerial extent of the Atlantic ice anomalies and thus could be quite large if the ice edge retreats as a result of global warming.},

	abstract = {[1] The radiation budget simulated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 40-year reanalysis (ERA40) is evaluated for the period 1979 - 2001 using independent satellite data and additional model data. This provides information on the quality of the radiation products and indirect evaluation of other aspects of the climate produced by ERA40. The climatology of clear-sky outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is well captured by ERA40. Underestimations of about 10 W m(-2) in clear-sky OLR over tropical convective regions by ERA40 compared to satellite data are substantially reduced when the satellite sampling is taken into account. The climatology of column-integrated water vapor is well simulated by ERA40 compared to satellite data over the ocean, indicating that the simulation of downward clear-sky longwave fluxes at the surface is likely to be good. Clear-sky absorbed solar radiation (ASR) and clear-sky OLR are overestimated by ERA40 over north Africa and high-latitude land regions. The observed interannual changes in low-latitude means are not well reproduced. Using ERA40 to analyze trends and climate feedbacks globally is therefore not recommended. The all-sky radiation budget is poorly simulated by ERA40. OLR is overestimated by around 10 W m(-2) over much of the globe. ASR is underestimated by around 30 W m(-2) over tropical ocean regions. Away from marine stratocumulus regions, where cloud fraction is underestimated by ERA40, the poor radiation simulation by ERA40 appears to be related to inaccurate radiative properties of cloud rather than inaccurate cloud distributions.},

	abstract = {The Rapid Update Cycle ( RUC), an operational regional analysis - forecast system among the suite of models at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), is distinctive in two primary aspects: its hourly assimilation cycle and its use of a hybrid isentropic - sigma vertical coordinate. The use of a quasi-isentropic coordinate for the analysis increment allows the influence of observations to be adaptively shaped by the potential temperature structure around the observation, while the hourly update cycle allows for a very current analysis and short-range forecast. Herein, the RUC analysis framework in the hybrid coordinate is described, and some considerations for high-frequency cycling are discussed.A 20-km 50-level hourly version of the RUC was implemented into operations at NCEP in April 2002. This followed an initial implementation with 60-km horizontal grid spacing and a 3-h cycle in 1994 and a major upgrade including 40-km horizontal grid spacing in 1998. Verification of forecasts from the latest 20-km version is presented using rawinsonde and surface observations. These verification statistics show that the hourly RUC assimilation cycle improves short-range forecasts ( compared to longer-range forecasts valid at the same time) even down to the 1-h projection.},

	abstract = {The wintertime atmospheric circulation responses to observed patterns of North Atlantic sea surface temperature and sea ice cover trends in recent decades are studied by means of experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model. Here the relationship between the forced responses and the dominant pattern of internally generated atmospheric variability is focused on. The total response is partioned into a portion that projects onto the leading mode of internal variability (the indirect response) and a portion that is the residual from that projection (the direct response). This empirical decomposition yields physically meaningful patterns whose distinctive horizontal and vertical structures imply different governing mechanisms. The indirect response, which dominates the total geopotential height response, is hemispheric in scale with resemblance to the North Atlantic Oscillation or Northern Hemisphere annular mode, and equivalent barotropic in the vertical from the surface to the tropopause. In contrast, the direct response is localized to the vicinity of the surface thermal anomaly (SST or sea ice) and exhibits a baroclinic structure in the vertical, with a surface trough and upper-level ridge in the case of a positive heating anomaly, consistent with theoretical models of the linear baroclinic response to extratropical thermal forcing. Both components of the response scale linearly with respect to the amplitude of the forcing but nonlinearly with respect to the polarity of the forcing. The deeper vertical penetration of anomalous heating compared to cooling is suggested to play a role in the nonlinearity of the response to SST forcing.},

	abstract = {Observed multidecadal trends in extratropical atmospheric flow, such as the positive trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, may be attributable to a number of causes. This study addresses the question of whether the atmospheric trends may be caused by observed trends in oceanic boundary forcing. Experiments were carried out using the NCAR atmospheric general circulation model with specified sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice anomalies confined to the North Atlantic sector. The spatial pattern of the anomalous forcing was chosen to be realistic in that it corresponds to the recent 40-yr trend in SST and sea ice, but the anomaly amplitude was exaggerated in order to make the response statistically more robust. The wintertime response to both types of forcing resembles the NAO to first order. Even for an exaggerated amplitude, the atmospheric response to the SST anomaly is quite weak compared to the observed positive trend in the NAO, but has the same sign, indicative of a weak positive feedback. The anomalies in sea ice extent are more efficient than SST anomalies at exciting an atmospheric response comparable in amplitude to the observed NAO trend. However, this atmospheric response has the opposite sign to the observed trend, indicative of a significant negative feedback associated with the sea ice forcing. Additional experiments using SST anomalies with opposite sign to the observed trend indicate that there are significant nonlinearities associated with the atmospheric response. The transient eddy response to the observed SST trend is consistent with the positive NAO response, with the North Atlantic storm track amplifying downstream and developing a more pronounced meridional tilt. In contrast, the storm track response to the observed sea ice trend corresponds to a weaker, southward-shifted, more zonal storm track, which is consistent with the negative NAO response.},

All satellite products exhibit significant decreases in cloud fraction over the arctic seas during winter ( December, January, February) on the order of 5\%/ decade. An equally striking increase in spring ( March, April, May) cloudiness is evident from the TOVS Pathfinder (TPP) and the extended AVHRR Polar Pathfinder (APP-x) projects. In the Central Arctic these positive trends can be as large as 15\%/ decade. Surface observations from the Russian drifting meteorological stations are consistent with satellite-observed changes during the 1980s. Negative trends in spring cloudiness reported by Comiso [ 2003] are in conflict with these findings. Spring changes in cloudiness are associated with changes in the atmospheric circulation.

	doi = {10.1256/qj.04.83},
	abstract = {The primary driver of the climate system is the uneven distribution of incoming and outgoing radiation on earth. The incoming radiant energy is transformed into various forms (internal heat, potential energy, latent energy, and kinetic energy), moved around in various ways primarily by the atmosphere and oceans, stored and sequestered in the ocean, land, and ice components of the climate system, and ultimately radiated back to space as infrared radiation. The requirement for an equilibrium climate mandates a balance between the incoming and outgoing radiation, and further mandates that the flows of energy are systematic. These drive the weather systems in the atmosphere, currents in the ocean, and fundamentally determine the climate. Values are provided for the seasonal uptake and release of heat by the oceans that substantially moderate the climate in maritime regions. In the atmosphere, the poleward transports are brought about mainly by large-scale overturning, including the Hadley circulation in low latitudes, and baroclinic storms in the extratropics, but the seamless nature of the transports on about monthly time-scales indicates a fundamental link between the two rather different mechanisms. The flows of energy can be perturbed, causing climate change. This article provides an overview of the flows of energy, its transformations, transports, uptake, storage and release, and the processes involved. The focus is on the region 60�N to 60�S, and results are presented for the solstitial seasons and their differences to highlight the annual cycle. Challenges in better determining the surface heat balance and its changes with time are discussed. Copyright � 2004 Royal Meteorological Society},

NCAR CCM single column model experiments simulating convective warming of a cold airmass moving over open water and radiative cooling as it moves again over cold land/sea ice support the hypothesis that the −45°C threshold can be maintained for 10–14 days after convective warming occurs.

Using the reanalysis, supplemented by Arctic Ocean Buoy Program fields and in situ observations, a generalized depiction of the annual cycle of pressure fields over the Arctic may be constructed. Above the Canada Basin-Laptev Sea side of the Arctic, the annual cycle of surface pressure is dominated by the first harmonic, which has an amplitude of about 5 hPa and maximum pressure occurring in March. Along the periphery of northern Greenland and extending to the North Pole, a weak semiannual cycle is found in surface pressure with maxima in May and November. The presence p of the semiannual variation over time is highly variable.Dynamically, this progression of the annual cycle may be attributed to the transfer of atmospheric mass from Eurasia and into the Canadian Archipelago in spring and the reverse condition in autumn. Over the central Arctic Basin, springtime pressure increases result from an enhanced poleward mass transport from Eurasia. An increase of equatorward transport over the Canadian Archipelago in May and June results in central Arctic pressure decreases into summer. A less distinct temporal separation between the poleward Canadian transport and the equatorward Eurasian transport results in the weaker second pressure maximum in autumn.On interannual time-scales, atmospheric mass over the central Arctic is exchanged with the storm track centres of action in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. In particular, the large decrease in central Arctic Basin sea-level pressure during the late 1980s is due to a large transfer of atmospheric mass into the North Pacific.

This is 57 \% of the estimated total ice loss at the terminus (calving plus melting) at this time. Submarine melting may thus provide a significant contribution to the overall ablation of a tidewater glacier. Oceanographic measurements (conductivity-temperature-depth) made 200-500 in from the terminus identified an isohaline (27 ppt) and isothermal (7.2degreesC) layer extending from 130 in depth to the fjord floor. Capping this is a 40 in thick overflow plume, distinguished by high outflow rates, low salinity (22-25 ppt) and lower temperatures (5-6degreesC). Mixing models indicate that fresh water comprised about 11 \% of this plume; it originates mostly as subglacial discharge whose buoyancy drives convection at the terminus. Deep, warm saline waters are incorporated into the plume as it ascends, causing substantial melting of ice along the submarine face. The calving terminus undergoes seasonal changes that coincide with changes in subglacial discharge and fjord water temperatures, and we suggest that these fluctuations in terminus position are directly related to changes in submarine melting.},

Reconstructing the changing patterns of sea ice distribution in the recent past remains one of the outstanding challenges to the paleo-community. To evaluate the importance of these reconstructions we performed sensitivity tests using NCAR's Community Climate Model (CCM3), and a series of prescribed sea ice extents designed to capture the full range of Arctic sea ice variability under interglacial (Holocene) and full glacial (Last Glacial Maximum) boundary conditions. Our simulations indicate that surface temperatures and sea level pressures in winter (DJF) are most sensitive to changes in sea ice, and that these changes are propagated over the surrounding land masses in the North Atlantic, but that equivalent changes in sea ice produce smaller corresponding changes in temperature or sea level pressure in the North Pacific region. A comparison between CLIMAP (Map Chart Series MC-36, Geological Society of America, Boulder, CO, 1981) and a more realistic assessment of LGM sea ice yields dramatic changes in winter temperatures and precipitation patterns across Eurasia. These differences, forced only by changed sea ice conditions, reinforce the need to develop accurate maps of past sea ice to correctly simulate Late Quaternary environments. Such reconstructions also will be essential to validate the next generation of sea ice models.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the current state of observational, theoretical, and modeling knowledge of the midlatitude storm tracks of the Northern Hemisphere cool season.Observed storm track structures and variations form the first part of the review. The climatological storm track structure is described, and the seasonal, interannual, and interdecadal storm track variations are discussed. In particular, the observation that the Pacific storm track exhibits a marked minimum during midwinter when the background baroclinicity is strongest, and a new finding that storm tracks exhibit notable variations in their intensity on decadal timescales, are highlighted as challenges that any comprehensive storm track theory or model has to be able to address.Physical processes important to storm track dynamics make Lip the second part of the review. The roles played by baroclinic processes, linear instability, downstream development, barotropic modulation, and diabatic heating are discussed. Understanding of these processes form,,, the core of our current theoretical knowledge of storm track dynamics, and provides a context within which both observational and modeling results call be interpreted. The eddy energy budget is presented to show that all of these processes are important in the maintenance of the storm tracks.The final part of the review deals with the ability to model storm tracks. The success as well as remaining problems in idealized storm track modeling, which is based on a linearized dynamical system, are discussed. Perhaps on a more pragmatic side, it is pointed out that while the current generation of atmospheric general circulation models faithfully reproduce the climatological storm track structure, and to a certain extent, the seasonal and ENSO-related interannual variation,, of storm tracks, in-depth comparisons between observed and modeled storm track variations are still lacking.},

	abstract = {For most atmospheric fields, the larger part of the spatial variance is contained in the planetary scales. When examined over a limited area, these atmospheric fields exhibit an aperiodic structure, with large trends across the domain. Trying to use a standard (periodic) Fourier transform on regional domains results in the aliasing of large-scale variance into shorter scales, thus destroying all usefulness of spectra at large wavenumbers. With the objective of solving this particular problem, the authors have evaluated and adopted a spectral transform called the discrete cosine transform (DCT). The DCT is a widely used transform for compression of digital images such as MPEG and JPEG, but its use for atmospheric spectral analysis has not yet received widespread attention.First, it is shown how the DCT can be employed for producing power spectra from two-dimensional atmospheric fields and how this technique compares favorably with the more conventional technique that consists of detrending the data before applying a periodic Fourier transform. Second, it is shown that the DCT can be used advantageously for extracting information at specific spatial scales by spectrally filtering the atmospheric fields. Examples of applications using data produced by a regional climate model are displayed. In particular, it is demonstrated how the 2D-DCT spectral decomposition is successfully used for calculating kinetic energy spectra and for separating mesoscale features from large scales.},

The RADARSAT 24 day repeat cycle is nearly ideal for measuring slow ice motion (e.g. {\textless} 100 m a(-1)), but application of SAR interferometry is limited in Easter-moving areas. With a 1 day, repeat period, ERS-1/-2 tandem SAR data are much better matched to fast motion, but are not always available. Fortunately, several authors have demonstrated the ability to measure velocity in fast-moving areas by tracking SAR speckle from image to image, which works well even in the absence of visible features. While these estimates have intrinsically lower resolution and poorer accuracy than direct phase measurements, they serve well in areas where there are no data suitable for conventional interferometry. This paper describes algorithms I have developed for merging interferometric and speckle-tracking data from multiple swaths to form a single seamless mosaic of velocity At each point in the mosaic, all the available data are combined to produce estimates of the velocity and the associated error. This technique is demonstrated using RADARSAT data collected over Lambert Glacier, Antarctica, during AMM-1 and -2.},

	abstract = {[1] As part of ice albedo feedback studies during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) field experiment, we measured spectral and wavelength-integrated albedo on multiyear sea ice. Measurements were made every 2.5 m along a 200-m survey line from April through October. Initially, this line was completely snow covered, but as the melt season progressed, it became a mixture of bare ice and melt ponds. Observed changes in albedo were a combination of a gradual evolution due to seasonal transitions and abrupt shifts resulting from synoptic weather events. There were five distinct phases in the evolution of albedo: dry snow, melting snow, pond formation, pond evolution, and fall freeze-up. In April the surface albedo was high (0.8-0.9) and spatially uniform. By the end of July the average albedo along the line was 0.4, and there was significant spatial variability, with values ranging from 0.1 for deep, dark ponds to 0.65 for bare, white ice. There was good agreement between surface-based albedos and measurements made from the University of Washington's Convair-580 research aircraft. A comparison between net solar irradiance computed using observed albedos and a simplified model of seasonal evolution shows good agreement as long as the timing of the transitions is accurately determined.},

	abstract = {[1] Measurements at the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean Experiment (SHEBA) Atmospheric Surface Flux Group (ASFG) tower site from October 1997 to October 1998 are used to describe the annual cycle of the near-surface environment and the surface energy budget (SEB). Comparisons with historical data and climatological estimates suggest that the SHEBA site was 3-8degreesC warmer in March and April. The unique SHEBA profile measurements showed that the mean near-surface environment is strongly stable during 6 winter months, and near neutral or weakly stable during the other months. However, one-hour data show that neutral stratification does occur 25\% of the time during the winter. The monthly mean flux profiles suggest that turbulent processes cool the near-surface atmosphere during the winter and warm it during the summer, though the sign of the sensible heat flux is negative during both the winter and July. The SHEBA SEB calculation is unique in its nearly exclusive use of observed rather than derived values. The magnitude of the best estimate of the annual net observed surface energy surplus at SHEBA (8.2 W m(-2)) was consistent with the observed surface ice and snowmelt and was in reasonable agreement with most previous estimates of the net annual SEB over the Arctic pack ice. However, the partitioning of the various components of the SEB differed in the SHEBA data. The SHEBA site had unusually large incoming longwave radiation in the fall and spring, giving an annual mean that was larger by 10.4-19.3 W m(-2). The site also had substantially less incoming solar radiation during most months than in previous estimates, producing a difference in the annual mean of 5.0-9.5 W m(-2) when compared to these estimates. The observed magnitudes of the sensible (-2.2 W m(-2)) and latent (1.1 W m(-2)) heat fluxes at SHEBA were smaller than previous climatological estimates, as were the conductive flux estimates (2.4-5.0 W m(-2)) at this site. Estimates of the measurement errors suggest that they are not likely to alter the conclusions concerning the SEB terms presented here but will prevent us from conclusively determining the reasons for the net thinning of the ice observed during SHEBA.},

Modulated by multi-decadal variability, SAT trends are often amplified relative to northern-hemispheric trends, but over the 125-year record we identify periods when arctic SAT trends were smaller or of opposite sign than northern-hemispheric trends. Arctic and northern-hemispheric air-temperature trends during the 20th century (when multi-decadal variablity had little net effect on computed trends) are similar, and do not support the predicted polar amplification of global warming. The possible moderating role of sea ice cannot be conclusively identified with existing data. If long-term trends are accepted as a valid measure of climate change, then the SAT and ice data do not support the proposed polar amplification of global warming. Intrinsic arctic variability obscures long-term changes, limiting our ability to identify complex feedbacks in the arctic climate system.},

Strengthenings of the vortex tend to be followed by surface temperature anomalies in the opposite sense. During midwinter, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the equatorial stratosphere has a similar but somewhat weaker impact on NH weather, presumably through its impact on the strength and stability of the stratospheric polar vortex; that is, the easterly phase of the QBO favors an increased incidence of extreme cold events, and vice versa. The signature of the QBO in NH wintertime temperatures is roughly comparable in amplitude to that observed in relation to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon.},

Recommendations suggested for addressing the problem include switching to a hybrid coordinate system that transitions to a pressure coordinate in the stratosphere, and with a damping upper boundary condition. Certain climate diagnostics are greatly impacted by these pathologies.},

The focus is on the vertically integrated energy components, their monthly tendencies, transports, and divergences, using the most accurate computations in model and pressure coordinates. Approximate equations have often been used previously; although relatively small compared with the moist static energy, kinetic energy transports should be taken into account, as divergences can exceed several tens of watts per square meter. Changes in energy storage terms over a month are not negligible, as they are typically over 25 W m−2 in storm track regions. Transports of energy are meaningful only if the mass budget is closed. Typical magnitudes of the divergence of sensible heat and potential energy are very large (several hundred watts per square meter), but partly cancel when combined as dry static energy, reflecting the role of isentropic flow. The latent energy and sensible heat contributions are strongly positively correlated because of the dominance of low-level flow, and the latent energy divergence also cancels a large component of the dry static energy divergence, leaving a modest residual. This arises from the dominance of moist adiabatic processes in the Tropics and subtropics as the net divergent transports depend on temperature departures in the vertical from the saturated adiabatic lapse rate and their covariability with wind. Careful numerical treatments are required or else small errors in the large terms that should cancel can be amplified. Common assumptions that diagnostics can be computed on model terrain-following coordinates, which therefore vary from day to day as the surface pressure changes, lead to errors in energy budgets of the order of 5 W m−2 owing to the covariability of energy terms with surface pressure. How well model coordinate results can be replicated in pressure coordinates has been explored along with the role of vertical resolution using a postprocessor developed at NCAR. The standard 17-level reanalysis pressure level archive does not adequately resolve the atmosphere, and we propose a new set of 30 pressure levels that has 25-mb vertical resolution below 700 mb and 50-mb vertical resolution in the rest of the troposphere. The diagnostics reveal major problems in the NCEP reanalyses in the stratosphere that are inherent in the model formulation, making them unsuitable for quantitative use for energetics in anything other than model coordinates. In addition, small flaws are found in the ECMWF postprocessing onto pressure levels. These stem from the way the vector fields are truncated, which is a necessary step to avoid aliasing before putting the values out on a 2.5° grid. Moreover, it is desirable to compute the gridpoint values exactly rather than interpolating them from the Gaussian grid, as currently done by ECMWF. The diagnostic results computed with 30 levels replicate the full model level vertically integrated energy divergences to within about 2 W m−2 over the ocean, while errors exceed 10 W m−2 in small spots over Greenland, Antarctica, and the Himalayan–Tibetan Plateau complex.},

	abstract = {The world's climate appears now to be changing at an unprecedented rate. Shifts in the distribution and behaviour of insect and bird species indicate that biological systems are already responding to this change. It is well established that climate is an important determinant of the spatial and temporal distribution of vectors and pathogens. In theory, a change in climate would be expected to cause changes in the geographical range, seasonality (intra-annual variability), and in the incidence rate (with or without changes in geographical or seasonal patterns). The detection and then attribution of such changes to climate change is an emerging task for scientists. We discuss the evidence required to attribute changes in disease and vectors to the early effects of anthropogenic climate change. The literature to date indicates that there is a lack of strong evidence of the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases (i.e. malaria, dengue, leishmaniasis, tick-borne diseases). New approaches to monitoring, such as frequent and long-term sampling along transects to monitor the full latitudinal and altitudinal range of specific vector species, are necessary in order to provide convincing direct evidence of climate change effects. There is a need to reassess the appropriate levels of evidence, including dealing with the uncertainties attached to detecting the health impacts of global change., Population Biology of Emerging and Re-emerging Pathogens},

	abstract = {This paper addresses and documents a number of issues related to the implementation of an advanced land surface-hydrology model in the Penn State-NCAR fifth-generation Mesoscale Model (MM5). The concept adopted here is that the land surface model should be able to provide not only reasonable diurnal variations of surface heat fluxes as surface boundary conditions for coupled models, but also correct seasonal evolutions of soil moisture in the context of a long-term data assimilation system. In a similar way to that in which the modified Oregon State University land surface model (LSM) has been used in the NCEP global and regional forecast models, it is implemented in MM5 to facilitate the initialization of soil moisture. Also, 1-km resolution vegetation and soil texture maps are introduced in the coupled MM5-LSM system to help identify vegetation/water/ soil characteristics at fine scales and capture the feedback of these land surface forcings. A monthly varying climatological 0.15 degrees x 0.15 degrees green vegetation fraction is utilized to represent the annual control of vegetation on the surface evaporation. Specification of various vegetation and soil parameters is discussed, and the available water capacity in the LSM is extended to account for subgrid-scale heterogeneity. The coupling of the LSM to MM5 is also sensitive to the treatment of the surface layer, especially the calculation of the roughness length for heat/moisture. Including the effect of the molecular sublayer can improve the simulation of surface heat flux. It is shown that the soil thermal and hydraulic conductivities and the surface energy balance are very sensitive to soil moisture changes. Hence, it is necessary to establish an appropriate soil moisture data assimilation system to improve the soil moisture initialization at fine scales.},

These range from simple broadband albedo parameterizations that distinguish among snow-covered and bare ice to more sophisticated parameterizations that include dependence on ice and snow depth, solar zenith angle, and spectral resolution. Several sophisticated parameterizations have also been developed for thermodynamic sea ice models that additionally include dependence on ice and snow age, and melt pond characteristics. Observations obtained in the Arctic Ocean during 1997-1998 in conjunction with the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) and FIRE Arctic Clouds Experiment provide a unique data set against which to evaluate parameterizations of sea ice surface albedo. We apply eight different surface albedo parameterizations to the SHEBA/FIRE data set and evaluate the parameterized albedos against the observed albedos. Results show that these parameterizations yield very different representations of the annual cycle of sea ice albedo. The importance of details and functional relationships of the albedo parameterizations is assessed by incorporating into a single-column sea ice model two different albedo parameterizations, one complex and one simple, that have the same annually averaged surface albedo. The baseline sea ice characteristics and strength of the ice-albedo feedback are compared for the simulations of the different surface albedos.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic time-mean budgets of energy and water are evaluated in many atmospheric process studies. The errors of budget-derived quantities like sub-gridscale fluxes or diabatic heating are governed by the errors of the budgets. Here we consider 3D-budgets on the meso-beta scale over Europe. They are compiled from analyses of state quantities available from forecast centres.In the present study we found that the mandatory 6 hours sampling interval between synoptic observations is the main error source for routine time-mean budgets. The errors have been quantified (i) by first sampling forecast data of the German Europamodell every 5 minutes and averaging them over 12 hours (reference budget), and (ii) by sampling the same data only every 6 hours and averaging these also over 12 hours (routine budget). With this method we find that routine budgets in single atmospheric meso-beta scale columns show relative random errors of typically 200\% and systematic errors of up to 20\%, exclusively due to undersampling. Thus routine budgets, if applied to specific days at individual locations, cannot be expected to yield useful results, except perhaps for cases with extremely strong signal. Compositing over several hundreds of columns with similar weather reduces the random budget error down to about 50\%; this seems to be the best one can achieve for routine budgets. The systematic error of some budget quantities is caused by a correlation between the time of occurence of certain processes (mainly convection) and the sampling times. While this error cannot be reduced through compositing, we find that it can be crudely estimated by using different time averaging methods.As application for this method we determine sub-gridscale budget quantities over the BALTEX catchment (August-September 1995) for an ensemble of convectively active and an ensemble of rain-active columns. For the ensemble mean profiles we find, in terms of the diagnosed sub-gridscale test quantities diabatic heating and vertical moist enthalpy flux divergence, that their accuracy is sufficient to detect statistically significant differences between both ensembles. The diabatic heating is about the same for both ensembles, while the flux divergence in the convective ensemble is about three times as large as in the rain ensemble.},

The resulting 0.27 degreesC difference in simulated annual global surface air temperatures is reduced by a third, to 0.18 degreesC, when considering instead biases of +4\% and -4\%. More broadly, least squares fits through the temperature results of 17 simulations with ice concentration input changes ranging from increases of 50\% versus the control simulation to decreases of 50\% yield a yearly average global impact of 0.0107 degreesC warming for every 1\% ice concentration decrease, that is, 1.07 degreesC warming for the full +50\% to -50\% range. Regionally and on a monthly average basis, the differences can be far greater, especially in the polar regions, where wintertime contrasts between the +50\% and -50\% cases can exceed 30 degreesC. However, few statistically significant effects are found outside the polar latitudes, and temperature effects over the nonpolar oceans tend to be under 1 degreesC, due in part to the specification of an unvarying annual cycle of sea surface temperatures. The +/-7\% and +/-4\% results provide bounds on the impact (on GISS GCM simulations making use of satellite data) of satellite-derived ice concentration inaccuracies, +/-7\% being the current estimated average accuracy of satellite retrievals and +/-4\% being the anticipated improved average accuracy for upcoming satellite instruments. Results show that the impact on simulated temperatures of imposed ice concentration changes is least in summer, encouragingly the same season in which the satellite accuracies are thought to be worst. Hence, the impact of satellite inaccuracies is probably less than the use of an annually averaged satellite inaccuracy would suggest.},

Here emphasis is on the 50 yr of the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (January 1949-May 1999) to depict the interannual variability of the atmospheric moisture fluxes across 70 degreesN and their convergence farther north.Precipitation minus evaporation (P - E) calculated from moisture flux convergence is compared with three large-scale circulation patterns that strongly affect the interannual variability of P - E over the Arctic and its environs: the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), the Arctic oscillation (AO), and the North Pacific oscillation (NPO). The impact of the NAO and the closely related AO on Arctic Basin P - E is found to be marked, with a P - E: NAO winter correlation of 0.49 (0.56 for the AO). On an annual basis, Arctic Basin P - E is much more closely correlated with the NAO (0.69) than with the AO (0.49), consistent with the Atlantic Ocean domination of the northward poleward moisture flux across 70 degreesN. Regional analysis confirms that the NAO impact on P - E is concentrated around the periphery of the North Atlantic Ocean and extends north into the Arctic Ocean during winter. The NAO and AO differ in their P - E modulation over the northern Eurasia sector with the AO being much more important for all seasons except summer (winter AO: P - E correlation 0.53, NAO: P - E correlation 0.16), consistent with its much stronger impact on the atmospheric circulation in that area. The NPO was associated with a much more modest modulation of Arctic Basin P - E (winter correlation of 0.33 and annual value of 0.10), with its regional signal being strongest over Alaska, northwestern Canada, and areas to the north. About 40\% of the interwinter variance of P - E over the sector that includes northeastern Canada is linked with the combined influence of the NAO-AO and NPO.A region of large poleward moisture transport variability during summer was previously identified over western Siberia, east of the Urals, associated with the development of the Urals trough. Here it is shown that this is due to an opposing circulation pattern, with high (low) poleward moisture transport over the west Siberian plain during low (high) poleward moisture transport over Scandinavia. A pronounced trough-ridge pattern accompanies this circulation regime that is primarily confined to July. Because the summer moisture transport dominates the annual total for this region, these circulation patterns produce this area's large interannual poleward moisture transport variability.},

	abstract = {Abstract Comprehensive diagnostic comparisons and evaluations have been carried out with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) and European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalyses of the vertically integrated atmospheric energy budgets. For 1979 to 1993 the focus is on the monthly means of the divergence of the atmospheric energy transports. For February 1985 to April 1989, when there are reliable top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiation data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), the implied monthly mean surface fluxes are derived and compared with those from the assimilating models and from the Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS), both locally and zonally integrated, to deduce the implied ocean meridional heat transports. While broadscale aspects and some details of both the divergence of atmospheric energy and the surface flux climatological means are reproducible, especially in the zonal means, differences are also readily apparent. Systematic differences are typically ∼20 W m−2. The evaluation highlights the poor results over land. Land imbalances indicate local errors in the divergence of the atmospheric energy transports for monthly means on scales of 500 km (T31) of 30 W m−2 in both reanalyses and ∼50 W m−2 in areas of high topography and over Antarctica for NCEP/NCAR. Over the oceans in the extratropics, the monthly mean anomaly time series of the vertically integrated total energy divergence from the two reanalyses correspond reasonably well, with correlations exceeding 0.7. A common monthly mean climate signal of about 40 W m−2 is inferred along with local errors of 25 to 30 W m−2 in most extratropical regions. Except for large scales, there is no useful common signal in the tropics, and reproducibility is especially poor in regions of active convection and where stratocumulus prevails. Although time series of monthly anomalies of surface bulk fluxes from the two models and COADS agree very well over the northern extratropical oceans, the total fields all contain large systematic biases which make them unsuitable for determining ocean heat transports. TOA biases in absorbed shortwave, outgoing longwave and net radiation from both reanalysis models are substantial ({\textgreater}20 W m−2 in the tropics) and indicate that clouds are a primary source of problems in the model fluxes, both at the surface and the TOA. Time series of monthly COADS surface fluxes are shown to be unreliable south of about 20∘N where there are fewer than 25 observations per 5∘ square per month. Only the derived surface fluxes give reasonable implied meridional ocean heat transports.},

	abstract = {Poleward meridional moisture transport across the Southern Ocean during 1988 is investigated by applying conservation of mass to the wind derivation approach of Slonaker and Van Woert. The moisture field is from the Television and Infrared Observational Satellite (TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) Pathfinder A dataset. The wind field is first derived from a combination of the TOVS temperature profiles and a satellite-based surface wind field using the thermal wind relationship. Then a Lagrange multiplier is introduced in a variational procedure to constrain the wind to conserve mass.The introduction of the conservation of mass reduces the estimates of the moisture flux and net precipitation dramatically in comparison with the nonmass-conserved method in Slonaker and Van Woert. For instance, the estimates of the zonally averaged, vertically integrated moisture flux across 50 degreesS are reduced by 56\% and the net precipitation between the 50 degreesS and 60 degreesS latitude belt are reduced by 63\%. The reason for the difference is that the nonmass-conserved approach leads to unrealistically strong annual-mean winds in the lower troposphere, which results in an exaggerated mean moisture transport. In contrast, the mass-conserved annual-mean wind compares favorably with the radiosonde observations at Macquarie Island and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalyses, and it yields a mean moisture flux consistent with historical estimates.In contrast, the satellite-derived eddy moisture flux is underestimated by about 45\% when compared with the radiosonde and analysis studies. This underestimation is probably due to the lower spatial and temporal resolutions of the satellite observations and lack of certain types of ageostrophic winds in the wind derivation.},

It is based on the idea that regional-scale climate statistics are conditioned by the interplay between continental-scale atmospheric conditions and such regional features as marginal seas and mountain ranges. Following this "downscaling" idea, the regional model is forced to satisfy not only boundary conditions, possibly in a boundary sponge region, but also large-scale flow conditions inside the integration area. In the present paper the performance of spectral nudging in an extended climate simulation is examined. Its success in keeping the simulated state close to the driving state at larger scales, while generating smaller-scale features is demonstrated, and it is also shown that the standard boundary forcing technique in current use allows the regional model to develop internal states conflicting with the large-scale state. It is concluded that spectral nudging may be seen as a suboptimal and indirect data assimilation technique.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the time-mean planetary-scale deformation field and the structure of midlatitude storm tracks is studied in wintertime simulations of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Earth Observing System model. Model biases are determined by contrasting model simulations (forced by observed SSTs) with parallel analyses of NCEP-NCAR reanalyses. Barotropic diagnostics are employed to identify potential dynamical linkages between regional biases in the midlatitude storm tracks and the horizontal deformation field. Initial observational analyses confirm that synoptic eddies are optimally configured to transfer kinetic energy to the mean flow in the jet exit regions, where strong stretching deformation exists. In these regions, the major axes of the synoptic eddies are aligned along the dilatation axes of the mean Row. Consequently, mean flow advection stretches synoptic eddies along their major axes, thereby increasing their anisotropy and weakening their kinetic energy.A strong link is identified between model biases in the horizontal structure of the midlatitude storm tracks and the representation of upper-tropospheric barotropic deformation. In particular, model-simulated storm tracks extend too far downstream in regions where the zonal stretching deformation (associated with horizontal diffluence in jet exit regions) is either too weak in magnitude or displaced westward in comparison with observations. These biases are associated with anomalously weak or westward-displaced patterns of negative barotropic energy conversions, which normally act as a sink of synoptic eddy activity in the jet exit. The anomalous energy conversion patterns are primarily due to model biases in the winter-mean Row rather than the simulated horizontal eddy structures, which closely resemble observations.The results indicate that the horizontal structure of midlatitude storm tracks in climate models is strongly controlled by the large-scale patterns of barotropic deformation in the upper troposphere. It is suggested that barotropic deformation analyses may provide a useful diagnostic measure for assessing climate simulation errors in atmospheric general circulation models.},

For the forecast fields of the reanalyses, the ERA annually averaged P - E (precipitation minus evaporation/sublimation) field reproduces the major features of the basin perimeter as they are known, while the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis forecast fields contain a spurious wave pattern in both P and E. Comparisons between gauge data from Soviet drift camp stations and forecast P values of the reanalyses show reasonable agreement given the difficulties (i.e., gauge accuracy, translating location). When averaged for 70 degrees-90 degrees N, the ERA and NCEP-NCAR forecast P - E are similar in the annual cycle. Average reanalysis forecast values of E for the north polar cap are found to be 40\% or more too large based on comparisons using surface latent heat flux climatologies.Differences between a synthesized average moisture flux across 70 degrees N from rawinsonde data of the Historical Arctic Rawinsonde Archive (HARA) and the reanalysis data occur in the presence of rawinsonde network problems. It is concluded that critical deficiencies exist in the rawinsonde depiction of the summertime meridional moisture transport. However, it remains to be seen whether the rawinsonde estimate can be rectified with a different method. For 70 degrees-90 degrees N, annual moisture convergence (P - E) values from the ERA and NCEP-NCAR are very similar; for both reanalyses, annual P - E values obtained from forecast fields are much lower than those obtained from moisture flux convergence by about 60\%, indicating severe nonclosure of the atmospheric moisture budget. The nonclosure primarily results from anomalously large forecast E values. In comparison with other studies, reanalyses moisture convergence values are much more reasonable. A synthesis of the reanalysis moisture convergence values and more recent studies yields a value of 18.9 +/- 2.3 cm yr(-1) for the north polar cap.},

	abstract = {Away from the tropical Pacific Ocean, an ENSO event is associated with relatively minor changes of the probability distributions of atmospheric variables. It is nonetheless important to estimate the changes accurately for each ENSO event, because even small changes of means and variances can imply large changes of the likelihood of extreme values. The mean signals are not strictly symmetric with respect to El Nino and La Nina. They also depend upon the unique aspects of the SST anomaly patterns for each event. As for changes of variance and higher moments, little is known at present. This is a concern especially for precipitation, whose distribution is strongly skewed in areas of mean tropospheric descent.These issues are examined here in observations and GCM simulations of the northern winter (January-March, JFM). For the observational analysis, the 42-yr (1958-99) reanalysis data generated at NCEP are stratified into neutral, El Nino, and La Nina winters. The GCM analysis is based on NCEP atmospheric GCM runs made with prescribed seasonally evolving SSTs for neutral, warm, and cold ENSO conditions. A large number (180) of seasonal integrations, differing only in initial atmospheric states, are made each for observed climatological mean JFM SSTs, the SSTs for an observed warm event (JFM 1987), and the SSTs for an observed cold event (JFM 1989). With such a large ensemble, the changes of probability even in regions not usually associated with strong ENSO signals are ascertained.The results suggest a substantial asymmetry in the remote response to El Nino and La Nina, not only in the mean but also the variability. In general the remote seasonal mean geopotential height response in the El Nino experiment is stronger, but also more variable, than in the La Nina experiment. One implication of this result is that seasonal extratropical anomalies may not necessarily be more predictable during El Nino than La Nina. The stronger seasonal extratropical variability during El Nino is suggested to arise partly in response to stronger variability of rainfall over the central equatorial Pacific Ocean. The changes of extratropical variability in these experiments are large enough to affect substantially the risks of extreme seasonal anomalies in many regions. These and other results confirm that the remote impacts of individual tropical ENSO events can deviate substantially from historical composite El Nino and La Nina signals. They also highlight the necessity of generating much larger GCM ensembles than has traditionally been done to estimate reliably the changes to the full probability distribution, and especially the altered risks of extreme anomalies, during those events.},

	abstract = {Studies from a variety of disciplines document recent change in the northern high-latitude environment. Prompted by predictions of an amplified response of the Arctic to enhanced greenhouse forcing, we present a synthesis of these observations. Pronounced winter and spring warming over northern continents since about 1970 is partly compensated by cooling over the northern North Atlantic. Warming is also evident over the central Arctic Ocean. There is a downward tendency in sea ice extent, attended by warming and increased areal extent of the Arctic Ocean's Atlantic layer. Negative snow cover anomalies have dominated over both continents since the late 1980s and terrestrial precipitation has increased since 1900. Small Arctic glaciers have exhibited generally negative mass balances. While permafrost has warmed in Alaska and Russia, it has cooled in eastern Canada. There is evidence of increased plant growth, attended by greater shrub abundance and northward migration of the tree line. Evidence also suggests that the tundra has changed from a net sink to a net source of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Taken together, these results paint a reasonably coherent picture of change, but their interpretation as signals of enhanced greenhouse warming is open to debate. Many of the environmental records are either short, are of uncertain quality, or provide limited spatial coverage. The recent high-latitude warming is also no larger than the interdecadal temperature range during this century. Nevertheless, the general patterns of change broadly agree with model predictions. Roughly half of the pronounced recent rise in Northern Hemisphere winter temperatures reflects shifts in atmospheric circulation. However, such changes are not inconsistent with anthropogenic forcing and include generally positive phases of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations and extratropical responses to the El-Nino Southern Oscillation. An anthropogenic effect is also suggested from interpretation of the paleoclimate record, which indicates that the 20th century Arctic is the warmest of the past 400 years.},

	abstract = {Geopotential anomalies ranging from the Earth's surface to the middle stratosphere in the northern hemisphere are dominated by a mode of variability known as the Arctic Oscillation (AO). The AO is represented herein by the leading mode (the first empirical orthogonal function) of low-frequency variability of wintertime geopotential between 1000 and 10 hPa. In the middle stratosphere the signature of the AO is a nearly zonally symmetric pattern representing a strong or weak polar vortex. At 1000 hPa the AO is similar to the North Atlantic Oscillation, but with more zonal symmetry, especially at high latitudes. In zonal-mean zonal wind the AO is seen as a north-south dipole centered on 40 degrees-45 degrees N; in zonal-mean temperature it is seen as a deep warm or cold polar anomaly from the upper troposphere to similar to 10 hPa. The association of the AO pattern in the troposphere with modulation of the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex provides perhaps the best measure of coupling between the stratosphere and the troposphere. By examining; separately time series of AO signatures at tropospheric and stratospheric levels, it is shown that AO anomalies typically appear first in the stratosphere and propagate downward. The midwinter correlation between the 90-day low-pass-filtered 10-hPa anomaly and the 1000-hPa anomaly exceeds 0.65 when the surface anomaly time series is lagged by about three weeks. The tropospheric signature of the AO anomaly is characterized by substantial changes to the storm tracks and strength of the midtropospheric flow especially over the North Atlantic and Europe. The implications of large stratospheric anomalies as precursors to changes in tropospheric weather patterns are discussed.},

The product is a mixture of meltwater and seawater having properties intermediate between those of the two components. Density is one of the properties that is affected, and this has important implications for how the melt-induced changes are eventually manifested. Although the direct impact of melting is to cool and dilute the ocean, subsequent convection can carry the products of melting to parts of the water column where they are comparatively warm and salty. These principles are illustrated with a set of observations from the continental shelf of the Amundsen Sea. Measurements made near a floating glacier are used to calculate the concentration of meltwater in the water column. Concentrations approaching 2\% are associated with comparatively high temperatures, low dissolved oxygen concentrations, and negligible stable isotope anomalies.

	abstract = {A regional atmospheric climate model with a horizontal grid spacing of 55 km has been used to simulate the Antarctic atmosphere during an austral summer period. ECMWF reanalyses were used to force the atmospheric prognostic variables from the lateral boundaries. Sea surface temperatures and the sea ice mask in the model were prescribed from observations. Parameterizations of the physical processes were taken from the ECHAM4 general circulation model. Before applying the model to Antarctic conditions, several adjustments had been made to the original code. In particular, a better correspondence between model output and measurements was accomplished by 1) the use of a fixed value of 0.8 for the surface albedo rather than applying an albedo that linearly rises with surface temperature and 2) the use of the volumetric heat capacity and the thermal diffusivity of snow rather than employing the values for ice.The model is evaluated for the period 14-19 January 1993 (P1) on the basis of an extensive dataset compiled from measurements made at a site (Svea) in Dronning Maud Land. This dataset contains boundary layer temperature and specific humidity profiles, snow temperatures, and surface heat fluxes. The surface fluxes were obtained from direct measurements combined with an energy balance model. The atmospheric temperature profiles simulated at the grid points corresponding most closely to Svea are in good agreement with the measured profiles, although the model slightly overestimates the vertical temperature gradient. The model probably underestimates the turbulent transport of heat and moisture to atmospheric layers above roughly 200 m. At Svea a cloud cover of less than 0.5 octas was observed during P1. The model overestimates the cloud cover, which results in an underestimation of shortwave and an overestimation of longwave radiative fluxes at the surface. The simulated values for the net radiative fluxes, the heat flux into the snow, and the turbulent heat fluxes correspond within 4 W m(-2) to the fluxes that were inferred from measurements.},

The climatology represents the period 1961-90 and comprises a suite of nine variables: precipitation, wet-day frequency, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, vapor pressure, sunshine, cloud cover, ground frost frequency, and wind speed. The climate surfaces have been constructed from a new dataset of station 1961-90 climatological normals, numbering between 19 800 (precipitation) and 3615 (wind speed). The station data were interpolated as a function of latitude, longitude, and elevation using thin-plate splines. The accuracy of the interpolations are assessed using cross validation and by comparison with other climatologies.This new climatology represents an advance over earlier published global terrestrial climatologies in that it is strictly constrained to the period 1961-90, describes an extended suite of surface climate variables, explicitly incorporates elevation as a predictor variable, and contains an evaluation of regional errors associated with this and other commonly used climatologies. The climatology is already being used by researchers in the areas of ecosystem modelling, climate model evaluation, and climate change impact assessment.The data are available from the Climatic Research Unit and images of all the monthly fields can be accessed via the World Wide Web.},

	abstract = {This study presents an evaluation of the NCEP–NCAR Reanalysis (the reanalysis) by comparing its components of the earth radiation budget to satellite data. Monthly mean clear sky (CS) and total sky of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), as well as reflected solar radiation (RSW) for 1985 and 1986, are compared to the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) measurements from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE). The ERBE-derived data of Staylor and Wilbur are also utilized to validate surface albedo. There are two objectives to this study: (i) to document the general quality of the reanalysis radiation budget, and (ii) to identify some of the general problem areas in the reanalysis global data assimilation system (GDAS). The OLR comparisons show that the global annual mean from the reanalysis is approximately 1.5\% higher than that of ERBE. The zonal-average differences are strongly seasonal, which is particularly evident at high latitudes for the CS OLR, and at most latitudes for total-sky OLR. For the geographical distribution, the synoptic patterns from the reanalysis are in good agreement with the observations. Yet many regions in the Tropics and subtropics pose significant systematic biases. Possible causes are from shortcomings in the the cloud/moisture parameterizations of the reanalysis GDAS. The complex topography unresolvable by the T62 model could also be the cause for the biases in tall mountain regions. The global RSW comparisons show that the CS data from the reanalysis is in very good agreement with ERBE, while the total-sky RSW data overestimate ERBE by 12.6 W m−2 (∼10\%) globally. Persistent overestimates of RSW throughout the period indicate that the global energy budget for the reanalysis is not balanced. This result also is consistent with the finding in OLR suggesting that the reanalysis GDAS contains shortcomings in the cloud/moisture parameterizations. Another possibility for the difference in RSW is deficiencies in the GDAS shortwave parameterizations. Over the Sahara Desert, the reanalysis underestimates RSW, and overestimates OLR, both in the clear-sky and total-sky conditions. Comparison with the Staylor and Wilber ERBE-derived surface albedo suggests that GDAS surface albedo in this region should be increased by up to 0.1 (in albedo units). A comparison with the interannual variations of the satellite data for the boreal summer illustrates that the radiation budget data of the reanalysis contains a realistic climate signal.},

Observations, as well as predictions of large-scale climate models which include ocean circulation, reveal an anomalous cooling of northeastern Canada in recent decades, in contrast to the overall significant increase in average annual temperature in the Northern Hemisphere. Predictions from models are necessary to forecast the change in the treeline in the 21st century which may lead to a major loss of tundra. The rate of change in vegetation in response to climate change is poorly understood. The treeline in central Canada, for example, is showing infilling with trees, and in some locations, northerly movement of the boundary. The presence of sea ice in Hudson Bay and other coastal areas is a major factor affecting interactions between the marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Loss of ice and therefore hunting of seals by polar bears will reduce bear and arctic fox populations within the region. in turn, this is likely to have significant effects on their herbivorous prey populations and forage plants, Further, the undersurface of sea ice is a major site for the growth of algae and marine invertebrates which in turn act as food for the marine food web. A rise in sea-level may flood coastal saltmarsh communities leading to changes in plant assemblages and a decline in foraging by geese and other consumers. The anomalous cooling in the eastern Arctic, primarily in late winter and early spring, has interrupted northern migration of breeding populations of geese and ducks and led to increased damage to vegetation in southern arctic saltmarshes as a result of foraging. It is likely that there has been a significant loss of invertebrates in those areas where the vegetation has been destroyed, Warming will have major effects on permafrost distribution and on ground-ice resulting in a major destabilization of slopes and slumping of soil, and disruption of tundra plant communities. Disruption of peat and moss surfaces lead to loss of insulation, an increase in active-layer depth and changes in drainage and plant assemblages. Increases of UV-B radiation will strongly affect vulnerable populations of both plants and animals, The indigenous peoples will face major changes in life style, edibility of food and health standards, if there is a significant warming trend. The great need is for information which is sensitive to the changes and will assist in developing an understanding of the complex interactions of the arctic biota, human populations and the physical environment.},

	abstract = {The energy budget of the latest version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM3) is described. The energy budget at the top of the atmosphere and at the earth's surface is compared to observational estimates. The annual mean, seasonal mean, and seasonal cycle of the energy budget are evaluated in comparison with earth radiation budget data at the top of the atmosphere and with the NCAR Ocean Model (NCOM) forcing data at the ocean's surface. Individual terms in the energy budget are discussed. The transient response of the top-of-atmosphere radiative budget to anomalies in tropical sea surface temperature is also presented. In general, the CCM3 is in excellent agreement with ERBE data in terms of annual and seasonal means. The seasonal cycle of the top-of-atmosphere radiation budget is also in good ({\textless}10 W m(-2)) agreement with ERBE data. At the surface, the model shortwave Aux over the oceans is too large compared to data obtained by W. G. Large and colleagues (similar to 20-30 W m(-2)). It is argued that this bias is related to a model underestimate of shortwave cloud absorption. The major biases in the model are related to the position of deep convection in the tropical Pacific, summertime convective activity over land regions, and the model's inability to realistically represent marine stratus and stratocumulus clouds. Despite these deficiencies, the model's implied ocean heat transport is in very good agreement with the explicit ocean heat transport of the NCOM uncoupled simulations. This result is a major reason for the success of the NCAR Climate System Model.},

Heating mechanisms operating in various parts of the world are examined by comparing the horizontal distributions of the vertically integrated heat source 〈Q1〉 with those of the vertically integrated moisture sink 〈Q2〉 and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) flux and by comparing the vertical distributions of Q1 with those of Q2. In northern winter, the major heat sources are located (i) in a broad zone connecting the tropical Indian Ocean, Indonesia, and the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ); (ii) over the Congo and Amazon Basins; and (iii) off the east coasts of Asia and North America. In northern summer, the major heat sources are over (i) the Bay of Bengal coast, (ii) the western tropical Pacific, and (iii) Central America. Throughout the year, the South Indian Ocean, eastern parts of the North and South Pacific Oceans, and eastern parts of the North and South Atlantic Oceans remain to be heat sinks. The desert regions such as the Sahara are characterized by large sensible heating near the surface and intense radiative cooling aloft. Over the tropical oceans, heat released by condensation with deep cumulus convection provides the major heat source. The radiative cooling and moistening due to evaporation are dominant features over the subtropical oceans where subsidence prevails. Over the Tibetan Plateau, the profiles of Q1 and Q2 show the importance of sensible heating in spring and contributions from the release of latent heat of condensation in summer. Off the east coast of Japan, intense sensible and latent heat fluxes heat and moisten the lower troposphere during winter. Heat sources in various regions exhibit strong interannual variability. A long (4–5 yr) periodicity corresponding to the variations in OLR and sea surface temperature (SST) is dominant in the equatorial eastern and central Pacific Ocean, while a shorter-period oscillation is superimposed upon the long-period variation over the equatorial Indian Ocean. The interannual variations of 〈Q1〉, OLR, and SST are strongly coupled in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific. However, the coupling between the interannual variations of 〈Q1〉 and OLR with those of SST is weak in the equatorial western Pacific and Indian Ocean, suggesting that factors other than the local SST are also at work in controlling the variations of atmospheric convection in these regions.},

The CERES instrument was flown on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite in late 1997, and will be flown on the Earth Observing System morning satellite in 1998 and afternoon satellite in 2000. To minimize temporal sampling errors associated with satellite measurements, two methods have been developed for temporally interpolating the CERES earth radiation budget measurements to compute averages of top-of-the-atmosphere shortwave and longwave flux. The first method is based on techniques developed from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and provides radiation data that are consistent with the ERBE processing. The second method is a newly developed technique for use in the CERES data processing. This technique incorporates high temporal resolution data from geostationary satellites to improve modeling of diurnal variations of radiation due to changing cloud conditions during the day. The performance of these two temporal interpolation methods is evaluated using a simulated dataset. Simulation studies show that the introduction of geostationary data into the temporal interpolation process significantly improves the accuracy of hourly and daily radiative products. Interpolation errors for instantaneous flux estimates are reduced by up to 68\% for longwave flux and 80\% for shortwave flux.},

	abstract = {In this lecture, three major aspects of airborne gravimetry are presented: Introduction to system concepts Modelling of observables and estimation Boundary value problems. After an introduction which overviews some of the historical development, the concepts of airborne gravimetry are briefly discussed. Three major approaches to the measurement of gravity from a moving platform are then outlined, namely scalar gravimetry, vector gravimetry, and gravity gradiometry. Scalar gravimetry is currently the most widely used, although test results are available for all three approaches. In the second part, the model equations for scalar and vector gravimetry are stated and their error models are derived. Special emphasis is given to scalar gravimetry in this part. Error sources are discussed in detail and some examples are used to illustrate major points. Insight gained in the process is used for the subsequent design of estimation procedures. It appears that at this stage of system development, the iterative use of time domain and spectral methods is the most appropriate way to extract the gravity signal from the noisy data. In the third part, three groups of geodetic boundary value problems (BVPs), related to airborne gravimetry, are introduced and solutions to these problems are presented. BVPs using airborne gravimetric data only are formulated first, and their solutions are given in terms of a Taylor expansion and a Fourier transform. BVPs combining airborne data with other data on the ground are considered next. Solutions to them are derived by way of planar harmonic analysis. Finally, the concept of multiresolution BVPs is introduced, and the solutions are developed based on discrete wavelet transforms. A brief assessment of current trends in airborne gravimetry concludes the course.},

	abstract = {Possible methods for estimating surface fluxes include (i) use of bulk fluxes and in situ observations, (ii) use of model parameterizations to interpret specified inputs and compute surface fluxes, and (iii) various indirect methods, which rely on the fact that the mass and surface heat, energy, and momentum budgets must balance and so, given computations of all the other components in the various budget equations applied to fields either within the ocean or the atmosphere, fluxes may be inferred as a residual. This paper reviews the third approach using indirect methods and outlines the advantages associated with the use of global atmospheric analyses from four-dimensional data assimilation (4DDA). The time mean increment required in producing analyses in 4DDA is identical to the systematic short-term (6 h) assimilating model forecast error and is most likely due to errors in the model physics. Therefore, the analyses include a desirable fix, which allows the sum of the “physics” to be deduced from “dynamics.” The focus is on the heat and moisture budgets to infer surface heat fluxes and freshwater fluxes, but with the recognition of the need to balance the mass budget as well. The diurnal cycle of the vertically integrated mass budget for July 1985 and January 1996 from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (formerly the National Meteorological Center) reanalyses is presented, revealing the strong semidiurnal tide and highlighting the need for at least four-times-daily data. The new results reveal that gross violations of the mass budget continue to be present, but these can be allowed for. A discussion is given of other sources of errors contributing to the heat and moisture budgets.},

	abstract = {The NCEP and NCAR are cooperating in a project (denoted ''reanalysis'') to produce a 40-year record of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support of the needs of the research and climate monitoring communities. This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957-96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Gray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a ''quick look'' CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CDROM, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, ''C'' variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of reanalysis (1957-96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new types of satellite data. NCEP plans currently call for an updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system every five years or so. The successive reanalyses will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.},

	abstract = {The authors investigate the climmological heating of the Arctic by the atmospheric moist static energy (MSE) flux from lower latitudes based on 25 years (November 1964–1989) of the GFDL dataset. During the five month winter period (NDJFM) the transport of sensible heat by transient eddies is the largest component (50\%) at 70°N, followed by the transport of sensible but by standing eddies (25\%), and the moist static energy flux by the mean meridional circulation (25\%). The mean meridional circulation (MMC) changes from a Ferrel cell to a thermally direct circulation near 60°N; maximum horizontal velocities in the thermally direct circulation peak new 70°N. North of 60°N the sensible heat flux by the MMC is southward and opposes the greater northward transport of geopotential energy. The transport of energy is not uniform. Major pathways are the northward transport of positive anomalies through the Greenland and Barents Seas into the eastern Arctic and the southward transport of negative anomalies to the cast of the Siberian high. The Atlantic pathway in winter relates to transport by transient eddies, while the western Siberian flux relates to the standing eddy pattern. Interannual variability of northward MSE is concentrated in these two regions. The western Arctic Ocean from about 30° to 60°W receives about 50 W m−2 less energy flux convergence than the eastern Arctic. This result compares well with the observed minimum January surface air temperatures in the Canadian Basin of the western Arctic and implies that the greater observed ice thickness in this region may have a thermodynamic as well as a dynamic origin.},

	abstract = {The energy balance observed in the summer of 1991 during the Greenland Ice Margin EXperiment (GIMEX-91) is described. Several masts were erected along a transect perpendicular to the ice edge; from a point 90 km up the ice cap, through the ablation zone, down to a point 5.8 km within the tundra zone. The diurnal variation of the friction velocity, sensible heat flux and latent heat flux, both on a single day (22 July) and averaged over the complete observational period are discussed. The mean daily values of the sensible heat flux (positive upwards) over the ice were negative (about — 30 W/m 2), as the ice was melting during most of the observational period. On average the latent heat flux was positive, which moistened the boundary layer air flowing down the ice cap. Up the ice cap, more than about 20 km from the ice edge, the energy balance is driven by the net radiation which causes higher fluxes during the day than during the night. The smaller (more negative) sensible heat fluxes during the night accelerate the katabatic flow; this leads to a wind maximum late at night or early in the morning. This diurnal cycle in energy balance is very similar to that observed on the slopes of Antarctica. At the ice edge, the large difference between the radiative and thermal properties of the ice and the tundra exerts a strong thermal forcing on the katabatic flow, analogous to the land-sea breeze circulation. During day-time the thermal wind accelerates the katabatic flow, which leads to an enhancement of the turbulent exchange rate and turbulent fluxes.},

	abstract = {The heat budget has been computed locally over the entire globe for each month of 1988 using compatible top-of-the-atmosphere radiation from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment combined with European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric data. The effective heat sources and sinks (diabatic heating) and effective moisture sources and sinks for the atmosphere are computed and combined to produce overall estimates of the atmospheric energy divergence and the net flux through the Earth's surface. On an annual mean basis, this is directly related to the divergence of the ocean heat transport, and new computations of the ocean heat transport are made for the ocean basins. Results are presented for January and July, and the annual mean for 1988, along with a comprehensive discussion of errors. While the current results are believed to be the best available at present, there are substantial shortcomings remaining in the estimates of the atmospheric heat and moisture budgets. The issues, which are also present in all previous studies, arise from the diurnal cycle, problems with atmospheric divergence, vertical resolution, spurious mass imbalances, initialized versus uninitialized atmospheric analyses, and postprocessing to produce the atmospheric archive on pressure surfaces. Over land, additional problems arise from the complex surface topography, so that computed surface fluxes are more reliable over the oceans. The use of zonal means to compute ocean transports is shown to produce misleading results because a considerable part of the implied ocean transports is through the land. The need to compute the heat budget locally is demonstrated and results indicate lower ocean transports than in previous residual calculations which are therefore more compatible with direct ocean estimates. A Poisson equation is solved with appropriate boundary conditions of zero normal heat flux through the continental boundaries to obtain the ocean heat transport. Because of the poor observational data base, adjustments to the surface fluxes are necessary over the southern oceans. Error bars are estimated based on the large-scale spurious residuals over land of 30 W m-2 over 1000 km scales (1012 m2). In the Atlantic Ocean, a northward transport emerges at all latitudes with peak values of 1.1±0.2 PW (1 standard error) at 20 to 30°N. Comparable values are achieved in the Pacific at 20°N, so that the total is 2.1±0.3 PW. The peak southward transport is at 15 to 20°S of 1.9±0.3 PW made up of strong components from both the Pacific and Indian Oceans and with a heat flux from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean in the Indonesian throughflow. The pattern of poleward heat fluxes is suggestive of a strong role for Ekman transports in the tropical regions.},

A gridded sea-ice database, for which the record length is now approaching four decades for the Arctic and two decades for the Antarctic, is summarized here. The sea-ice fluctuations derived from the dataset are characterized by 1) temporal scales of several seasons to several years and 2) spatial scales of 30-degrees-180-degrees of longitude. The ice data are examined in conjunction with air temperature data for evidence of recent climate change in the polar regions. The arctic sea-ice variations over the past several decades are compatible with the corresponding air temperatures, which show a distinct warming that is strongest over northern land areas during the winter and spring. The temperature trends over the subarctic seas are smaller and even negative in the southern Greenland region. Statistically significant decreases of the summer extent of arctic ice are apparent in the sea-ice data, and new summer minima have been achieved three times in the past 15 years. There is no significant trend of ice extent in the Arctic during winter or in the Antarctic during any season. The seasonal and geographical changes of sea-ice coverage are consistent with the more recent greenhouse experiments performed with coupled atmosphere-ocean models.},

	abstract = {The information available on different scales in the atmosphere for a number of different variables is explored using the global ECMWF analyses by examining the spatial spectra at T106 resolution. In most atmospheric spectra, a low wavenumber regime can be identified that does not follow a power law and is dominated by the stationary forced part of the flow. A higher wavenumber regime, where an approximate power law does appear to hold, can also usually be found. For the rotational part of the flow in the upper troposphere, the observed spectra follow quite closely that expected for quasi-two-dimensional geostrophic turbulence between about wavenumbers 12 and 70, with a kinetic energy spectrum falling off as n−3, where n is the total spherical harmonic wavenumber. In the lower troposphere, there is more power at high wavenumbers than would be expected from geostrophic turbulence, most likely due to the influence and close proximity of the lower boundary. Changes in the global analyses since 1979 have mainly influenced the spectra in the lower troposphere and the more recent analyses for 1988 have more power at higher wavenumbers. In the stratosphere, the spectra at high wavenumbers do not follow a power law behavior very well. The widespread practice of using a coarse grid without the appropriate truncation or smoothing first can result in unresolved scales being aliased and excessively noisy fields; an example is the 2.5° gridded fields made available by ECMWF. Appropriate procedures are described for truncating the T106 ECMWF spectral archive for scalar and vector fields. T42 resolution is an adequate representation for diagnostic calculations depicting most quantities within a few percent accuracy, although some spatial structure, which may partly be noise, is lost for the w, divergence, and moisture fields. In contrast, errors greater than 10\% can occur at T21 or R15 resolution, although these truncations can be useful for displaying results.},

	abstract = {The extent to which mass is conserved in European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses archived on pressure surfaces is examined from two perspectives and with two different datasets. The data used come from the WMO archive of 7-level, twice daily initialized analyses and from the WCRP archive of 14-level, four-times daily uninitialized analyses. The first perspective, which considers the equation of continuity in pressure coordinates locally in three dimensions, reveals spurious residuals in the equation of up to 100\% of the size of the divergence term, with largest errors of 60\% to 100\% in the tropics. In this case the horizontal velocity and vertical p-velodty (ω) fields are checked for consistency. Modest improvements occur when 14 versus 7 levels are used. The second perspective considers the vertical integral in which the surface pressure tendency should balance the total mass convergence into a column, and thus does not involve the omega fields. The latter reveals that the dominant residual is due to the failure to resolve the semidiurnal tide with only twice-daily data, so that a large-scale wavenumber 2 pattern with maxima in the tropics results as a residual. However, there are also many smaller scale and smaller amplitude features in the residual that cannot be explained simply. The residuals from the uninitialized analyses are much larger so that while four-times daily data removes much of the wavenumber 2 semidiurnal tide structure, the total residuals are just as large as with the twice-daily initialized data. Improvements in using 14 levels versus 7 are marginal for the vertical integral. The moisture budget, which is an important part of the overall mass budget, produces plausible estimates of vertically integrated evaporation minus precipitation, but needs to be validated. The primary source of the mass imbalance arises from the methods of postprocessing the variables onto pressure surfaces. Because sophisticated four-dimensional data assimilation now performs analyses of fields on model (sigma) surfaces, the postprocessing performs interpolations (using splines under tension) from model coordinates to pressure coordinates, with the result that the archived variables are really representative of individual levels rather than finite-sized layers. The implications are that residuals computed in other budgets, such as diabatic heating from the thermodynamic equation, will also include large errors, most of which will, however, be systematic. The effects of several common approximations in the treatment of the lower boundary on mass conservation are examined, and proper accounting for the full variations in both space and time of surface pressure on vertical mass integrals lead to the computation of kinematic orographic forcing from the analyses as a residual. The diagnosed lower boundary-induced vertical motions are weak and do not reveal the strong dipole patterns normally expected, which may indicate that the planetary waves are not adequately forced in the forecast model used in the four-dimensional data assimilation.},

The data demonstrate that the anomalously strong katabatic winds of Adelie Land are not unique, and thus strongly support the proposition that most of the cold boundary layer air from the ice sheet crosses the coastline in a small number of narrow zones. Furthermore the observations prove that katabatic winds can routinely blow for substantial distances across flat terrain in marked contrast to the abrupt dissipation previously monitored just offshore from East Antarctica. Winter wind conditions onset suddenly in mid-February and are characterized by negligible directional variations and by speeds mostly ranging between 10 and 30 m s−1. Katabatic winds at Terra Nova Bay both affect and are affected by the regional atmospheric circulation. This katabatic airflow is a time-averaged source of cold boundary layer air ...},

A detailed diagnosis is made of a simulation in which katabatic flow develops from rest due to the strong radiational cooling of the underlying surface. Significant thermodynamic and dynamic differences are seen between the gravity-driven flows over the gently-sloping interior and over the steep ice slopes near the coast. The strongest temperature inversions and largest static stabilities are found over the interior of the continent, although the net cooling of the katabatic layer and magnitude of the downslope-directed horizontal pressure gradient force are greatest at the coast. The interior is characterized by low Rossby number, quasi-geostrophic type flows, while more intense, near-antitriptic winds occur at the coast. Model results are in reasonable agr...},

	abstract = {A numerical model for the simulation of sea ice circulation and thickness over a seasonal cycle is presented. This model is used to investigate the effects of ice dynamics on Arctic ice thickness and air-sea heat flux characteristics by carrying out several numerical simulations over the entire Arctic Ocean region. The essential idea in the model is to couple the dynamics to the ice thickness characteristics by allowing the ice interaction to become stronger as the ice becomes thicker and/or contains a lower areas percentage of thin ice. The dynamics in turn causes high oceanic heat losses in regions of ice divergence and reduced heat losses in regions of convergence. TO model these effects consistently the ice is considered to interact in a plastic manner with the plastic strength chosen to depend on the ice thickness and concentration. The thickness and concentration, in turn, evolve according to continuity equations which include changes in ice mass and percent of open water due to advection, ice deformation and thermodynamic effects. For the standard experiment an integration of eight years in length is performed at one day timesteps and 125 km resolution in order to obtain a cyclic equilibrium. A zero ice strength condition is used at the Greenland-Spitsbergen passage to allow natural outflow or inflow. Several other shorter experiments, including a case without open water effects, are also run for comparison. Input fields consist of observed time varying geostrophic winds over a one year period, fixed geostrophic ocean currents, and geographically invariant ice growth rates dependent on ice thickness and season. Many of the observed features of the circulation and thickness of the Arctic ice cover are reproduced by the model. The average annual drift shows the classic anticyclonic ice flow in the Beaufort Sea together with a transpolar drift of ice from the Siberian coast toward the Greenland Sea. In addition, the nonlinear plastic rheology allows the formation of a shear zone (velocity discontinuity) from time to time off the North Slope of Alaska. The average rate of ice export out of the basin is ∼0.1 Sv in reasonable agreement with observational estimates. Geographical ice thickness contours show ice in excess of 6 m along the Canadian Archipelago with thicknesses decreasing to 2 m near the Siberian coast. The form of these contours is in good agreement with that estimated from submarine sonar data and aerial ridge surveys. In summer a low compactness region of up to 50\% open water builds up off the Alaskan and Siberian coasts, in general agreement with satellite-derived ice concentration charts. Further from shore, smaller, but still significant, amounts (∼10\%) of open water also form in summer. An important, less verifiable characteristic is that the annual net ice production is dominated by the North Slope and Siberian nearshore regions where, on the average, offshore advection creates open water and thinner ice. Overall the simulation results suggest that lateral heat transport due to ice motion is of the same order of magnitude as vertical air-sea heat fluxes.},

	abstract = {In regions where strong katabatic winds occur, notably Commonwealth Bay, Antarctica, there is often a sharp boundary between the strong winds and the comparatively calm conditions at sea. The seaward movement of this boundary across a coastal station is accompanied by a sudden onset of strong winds and the landward movement by their sudden cessation. The boundary has all the characteristics of a pressure jump line accompanying a sudden change in depth of the cold air. Further-more, it is to be expected from theoretical considerations that a pressure jump will occur near the coast. A simple theory is developed from which various characteristics of the flow can be predicted, including the intensity of the jump and the deviation of the wind from the lines of greatest slope caused by the Earth's rotation. These predictions agree moderately well with observations.},

	url = {http://www.usask.ca/hydrology/papers/Aksamit_Pomeroy_2015.pdf},
	abstract = {The current understanding of blowing snow transport is derived from coupling time-averaged measurements of particle saltation and suspension with nearby wind measurements. Recently, two-phase aeolian flow studies have benefited from high frequency turbulence measurements and particle tracking, allowing a stronger comprehension of particle flow dynamics. However, these sand-based transport observations cannot be directly adopted for saltating snow because they assume an underlying bed of discrete particles and so neglect the bonds and structural metamorphism unique to snow crystal matrix structures. To examine the potential distinctive nature of snow saltation, this study employs laser illuminated high-speed videography and ultrasonic anemometry to examine snow transport over a natural snowpack in detail. A saltating snow measurement site was established at the Fortress Mountain Snow Laboratory, Alberta, Canada and instrumented with two Campbell CSAT3 ultrasonic anemometers sampling at 50 Hz and a two dimensional Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) system. The experiment has demonstrated the applicability of PTV methods to outdoor environments for blowing snow studies. A three species sub-classification of saltation from blowing sand studies allows for description of overlooked snow transport and initiation processes. However, complex behaviour that is specific to blowing snow such as the tumbling and disintegration of aggregate snow crystals, which eject smaller grains and feed disintegrating grains into the atmosphere has also been documented, complicating direct sand subspecies application. This unique avenue of data informs a new conceptualization of saltating snow transport mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) is applied to the Antarctic Ice Sheet over the last two glacial cycles (≈ 210,000 years) with a resolution of 16 km. A Large Ensemble of 256 model runs is analyzed in which four relevant model parameters have been systematically varied using full-factorial parameter sampling. Parameters and plausible parameter ranges have been identified in a companion paper (Albrecht et al., 2019) and are associated with ice dynamics, climatic forcing, basal sliding and bed deformation and represent distinct classes of model uncertainties. The model is calibrated against both modern and geologic data, including reconstructed grounding line locations, elevation-age data, ice thickness and surface velocities as well as uplift rates. An aggregated score is computed for each ensemble member that measures the overall model-data misfit, including measurement uncertainty in terms of a Gaussian error model (Briggs and Tarasov, 2013). The statistical method used to analyze the ensemble simulation results follows closely the simple averaging method described in Pollard et al. (2016). This analysis further constrains relevant model and boundary parameters by revealing clusters of best fit parameter combinations. The ensemble of reconstructed histories of Antarctic Ice Sheet volumes provides a score-weighted likely range of sea-level contributions since the Last Glacial Maximum of 9.4 ± 4.1 m (or 6.5 ± 2.0 × 106 km3), which is at the upper range of previous studies. The last deglaciation occurs in all ensemble simulations after around 12,000 years before present, and hence after the Meltwater Pulse-1A. Our Large Ensemble analysis also provides well-defined parametric uncertainty bounds and a probabilistic range of present-day states that can be used for PISM projections of future sea-level contributions from the Antarctic Ice Sheet.},

Based on these high-latitude data, the interpretation of PIESs’ acoustic travel-time records from regions that are periodically ice covered were refined. In addition, new methods using PIESs for detecting icebergs and sea ice and for estimating iceberg drafts and drift speeds were developed and tested. During winter months, the PIES in Sermilik Fjord logged about 300 iceberg detections and recorded a 2-week period in early March of land-fast ice cover over the instrument site, consistent with satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The deepest icebergs in the fjord were found to have keel depths greater than approximately 350 m. Average and maximum iceberg speeds were approximately 0.2 and 0.5 m s−1, respectively. The maximum tidal range at the site was ±1.8 m and during neap tides the range was ±0.3 m, ...},

	abstract = {Tropical glaciers constitute an important source of water for downstream populations. However, our understanding of glacial melt processes is still limited. One observed process that has not yet been quantified for tropical glaciers is the enhanced melt caused by the longwave emission trans- fer. Here, we use high-resolution surface temperatures obtained from the thermal infrared imagery of the Cuchillacocha Glacier, in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru in June 2014 to calculate a margin longwave flux. This longwave flux, reaching the glacier margin from the adjacent exposed rock, varies between 81 and 120 W m−2 daily. This flux is incorporated into a physically-based melt model to assess the net radiation budget at the modeled glacier margin. The simulation results show an increase in the energy available for melt by an average of 106 W m−2 during the day when compared with the simulation where the LWmargin flux is not accounted for. This value represents an increase in ablation of ∼1.7 m at the glacier margin for the duration of the dry season. This study suggests that including the quantification of the glacier margin longwave flux in physically-based melt models results in an improved assessment of tropical glacier energy budget and meltwater generation.},

	abstract = {Neighboring tidewater glaciers often exhibit asynchronous dynamic behavior, despite relatively uniform regional atmospheric and oceanic forcings. This variability may be controlled by a combination of local factors, including glacier and fjord geometry, fjord heat content and circulation, and glacier surface melt. In order to characterize and understand contrasts in adjacent tidewater glacier and fjord dynamics, we made coincident ice-ocean-atmosphere observations at high temporal resolution (minutes to weeks) within a 10 000 km2 area near Uummannaq, Greenland. Water column velocity, temperature and salinity measurements reveal systematic differences in neighboring fjords that imply contrasting circulation patterns. The observed ocean velocity and hydrography, combined with numerical modeling, suggest that subglacial discharge plays a major role in setting fjord conditions. In addition, satellite remote sensing of seasonal ice flow speed and terminus position reveal both speedup and slow-down in response to melt, as well as differences in calving style among the neighboring glaciers. Glacier force budgets and modeling also point toward subglacial discharge as a key factor in glacier behavior. For the studied region, individual glacier and fjord geometry modulate subglacial discharge, which leads to contrasts in both fjord and glacier dynamics.},

	abstract = {Abstract. High-resolution, well-dated climate archives provide an
opportunity to investigate the dynamic interactions of climate patterns
relevant for future projections. Here, we present data from a new, annually
dated ice core record from the eastern Ross Sea, named the Roosevelt Island
Climate Evolution (RICE) ice core. Comparison of this record with climate
reanalysis data for the 1979–2012 interval shows that RICE reliably captures
temperature and snow precipitation variability in the region. Trends over the
past 2700 years in RICE are shown to be distinct from those in West
Antarctica and the western Ross Sea captured by other ice cores. For most of
this interval, the eastern Ross Sea was warming (or showing isotopic
enrichment for other reasons), with increased snow accumulation and perhaps
decreased sea ice concentration. However, West Antarctica cooled and the
western Ross Sea showed no significant isotope temperature trend. This
pattern here is referred to as the Ross Sea Dipole. Notably, during the
Little Ice Age, West Antarctica and the western Ross Sea experienced colder
than average temperatures, while the eastern Ross Sea underwent a period of
warming or increased isotopic enrichment. From the 17th century onwards, this
dipole relationship changed. All three regions show current warming, with
snow accumulation declining in West Antarctica and the eastern Ross Sea but
increasing in the western Ross Sea. We interpret this pattern as reflecting
an increase in sea ice in the eastern Ross Sea with perhaps the establishment
of a modern Roosevelt Island polynya as a local moisture source for RICE.},

Tracing meltwater pathways from ice shelves is important for identifying the regions most affected by the increased input of this water type. Here, optimum multiparameter analysis is used to deduce glacial meltwater fractions from water mass characteristics (temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen concentrations), collected during a ship-based campaign in the eastern Amundsen Sea in February–March 2014. Using a one-dimensional ocean model, processes such as variability in the characteristics of the source water masses on shelf and biological productivity/respiration are shown to affect the calculated apparent meltwater fractions. These processes can result in a false meltwater signature, creating misleading apparent glacial meltwater pathways. An alternative glacial meltwater calculation is suggested, using a pseudo–Circumpolar Deep Water endpoint and using an artificial increase...},

The sensitivity of the RASM near-surface climate to changes in atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice parameters and physics is evaluated in four simulations. The near-surface atmospheric circulation is well simulated in all four RASM simulations but biases in surface temperature are caused by biases in downward surface radiative fluxes. Errors in radiative fluxes are due to biases in simulated clouds with different versions of RASM simulating either too much or too little cloud radiative impact over open ocean regions and all versions simulating too little cloud radiative impact over land areas. Cold surface temperature biases in the central Arctic in winter are likely due to too few or too radiatively thin clouds. The precipitation simulated by RASM is sensitive to changes in evaporation that were linked to sea surface temperature...},

In accordance with this, two-phase tropical precipitation shifts are suggested, involving a fast component dominated by the high-northern-latitude forcing and a slower component due to the southern-high-latitude forcing. The results may thus be useful for the future understanding and interpretation of high-resolution tropical paleoprecipitation proxies and their relation to high-latitude records (e.g., ice core data).

It was suggested that atmospheric northward energy transport (ANET) into the Arctic had contributed to tropospheric warming in the Arctic. Here we calculate ANET based on the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data from 1979 to 2012. During this period the zonally integrated energy flux into the Arctic has decreased rather than increased in all seasons. However, the trends are statistically insignificant except for the winter and annual mean fluxes. For the winter season, the transient eddy flux of energy increases over Greenland and the Greenland Sea and decreases over west-central Siberia (WCS). Trends in meridional wind variance and vorticity also indicate increasing transient eddy activity over Northern Canada, the Greenland Sea and the Norwegian Sea and decreasing activity over WCS. Inter-winter variations in local vorticity over the WCS are significantly anti-correlated with the Arctic climate.},

	abstract = {AbstractThis study presents the first continuous, high spatiotemporal resolution time series of landfast sea ice extent along the East Antarctic coast for the period March 2000–December 2008. The time series was derived from consecutive 20-day cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composite images. Fast ice extent across the East Antarctic coast shows a statistically significant (1.43\% ±0.30\% yr−1) increase. Regionally, there is a strong increase in the Indian Ocean sector (20°–90°E, 4.07\% ±0.42\% yr−1), and a nonsignificant decrease in the western Pacific Ocean sector (90°–160°E, −0.40\% ±0.37\% yr−1). An apparent shift from a negative to a positive extent trend is observed in the Indian Ocean sector from 2004. This shift also coincides with a greater amount of interannual variability. No such shift in apparent trend is observed in the western Pacific Ocean sector, where fast ice extent is typically higher and variability lower than the Indian Ocean sector.

	doi = {10.5194/tc-12-3813-2018},
	abstract = {Abstract. Rapid changes in thickness and velocity have been
observed at many marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland, impacting the
volume of ice they export, or discharge, from the ice sheet. While annual
estimates of ice-sheet-wide discharge have been previously derived,
higher-resolution records are required to fully constrain the temporal
response of these glaciers to various climatic and mechanical drivers that
vary in sub-annual scales. Here we sample outlet glaciers wider than 1km
(N=230) to derive the first continuous, ice-sheet-wide record of total ice
sheet discharge for the 2000–2016 period, resolving a seasonal variability
of 6\%. The amplitude of seasonality varies spatially across the ice
sheet from 5\% in the southeastern region to 9\% in the northwest
region. We analyze seasonal to annual variability in the discharge time
series with respect to both modeled meltwater runoff, obtained from
RACMO2.3p2, and glacier front position changes over the same period. We find
that year-to-year changes in total ice sheet discharge are related to annual
front changes (r2=0.59, p=10-4) and that the annual
magnitude of discharge is closely related to cumulative front position
changes (r2=0.79), which show a net retreat of {\textgreater}400km,
or an average retreat of {\textgreater}2km, at each surveyed glacier. Neither
maximum seasonal runoff or annual runoff totals are correlated to annual
discharge, which suggests that larger annual quantities of runoff do not
relate to increased annual discharge. Discharge and runoff, however, follow
similar patterns of seasonal variability with near-coincident periods of
acceleration and seasonal maxima. These results suggest that changes in
glacier front position drive secular trends in discharge, whereas the impact
of runoff is likely limited to the summer months when observed seasonal
variations are substantially controlled by the timing of meltwater input.},

modulate ice-flow velocities over periods of months to years. Although
subglacial lake drainage events have been observed from

long-term evolution of ice-sheet basal hydrology. Here, we
systematically map and model past water flow through an extensive area
containing over 1000 subglacial channels and 19 former lake basins exposed
on over 19 000 km2 of seafloor by the retreat of Pine Island and
Thwaites glaciers, West Antarctica. At 507 m wide and 43 m deep on average,
the channels offshore of present-day Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers
are approximately twice as deep, 3 times as wide, and cover an area over
400 times larger than the terrestrial meltwater channels comprising the
Labyrinth in the Antarctic Dry Valleys. The channels incised into bedrock
offshore of contemporary Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers would have been
capable of accommodating discharges of up to 8.8×106 m3 s−1. We suggest that the channels were formed by episodic discharges
from subglacial lakes trapped during ice-sheet advance and retreat over
multiple glacial periods. Our results document the widespread influence of
episodic subglacial drainage events during past glacial periods, in
particular beneath large ice streams similar to those that continue to
dominate contemporary ice-sheet discharge.},

	doi = {10.5194/tc-13-723-2019},
	abstract = {Abstract. Calving-front dynamics is an important
control on Greenland's ice mass balance. Ice front retreat of
marine-terminating glaciers may, for example, lead to a loss in resistive
stress, which ultimately results in glacier acceleration and thinning. Over
the past decade, it has been suggested that such retreats may be triggered by
warm and salty Atlantic Water, which is typically found at a depth below
200–300 m. An increase in subglacial water discharge at glacier ice fronts
due to enhanced surface runoff may also be responsible for an intensification
of undercutting and calving. An increase in ocean thermal forcing or
subglacial discharge therefore has the potential to destabilize
marine-terminating glaciers along the coast of Greenland. It remains unclear
which glaciers are currently stable but may retreat in the future and how far
inland and how fast they will retreat. Here, we quantify the sensitivity and
vulnerability of marine-terminating glaciers along the northwest coast of
Greenland (from 72.5 to 76∘ N) to ocean forcing and subglacial
discharge using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). We rely on a
parameterization of undercutting based on ocean thermal forcing and
subglacial discharge and use ocean temperature and salinity from
high-resolution ECCO2 (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean,
Phase II) simulations at the fjord mouth to constrain the ocean thermal
forcing. The ice flow model includes a calving law based on a tensile von
Mises criterion. We find that some glaciers, such as Dietrichson Gletscher or
Alison Glacier, are sensitive to small increases in ocean thermal forcing,
while others, such as Illullip Sermia or Cornell
Gletscher, are remarkably stable,
even in a +3 ∘C ocean warming scenario. Under the most intense
experiment, we find that Hayes Gletscher retreats by more than 50 km inland by 2100 into a deep trough,
and its velocity increases by a factor of 3 over only 23 years. The model
confirms that ice–ocean interactions can trigger extensive and rapid glacier
retreat, but the bed controls the rate and magnitude of the retreat. Under
current oceanic and atmospheric conditions, we find that this sector of the
Greenland ice sheet alone will contribute more than 1 cm to sea level rise
and up to 3 cm by 2100 under the most extreme scenario.},

A general circulation model forced by stratospheric ozone depletion representative of the ozone hole period successfully reproduced these observed changes. Investigation of the dynamical characteristics of the model therefore provides some insight into the actual mechanisms. From this the authors suggest the following: 1) An initial (radiative) strengthening of the lower-stratospheric winds as a result of ozone depletion conditions the polar vortex so that fewer planetary waves propagate up from the troposphere, resulting in weaker planetary wave driving. 2) This causes further strengthening of the vortex, which results in an additional reduction in upward-propagating planetary waves and initiates a positive feedback mechanism in which the weaker wave driving and the associated strengthened wind...},

The analysis uses highly accurate, full-depth, ship-based, conductivity–temperature–depth measurements taken along repeated oceanographic sections around the Southern Ocean. Fresher varieties of AABW are present within the South Pacific and south Indian Oceans in the 2000s compared to the 1990s, with the strongest freshening in the newest waters adjacent to the Antarctic continental slope and rise indicating a recent shift in the salinity of AABW produced in this region. Bottom waters in the Weddell Sea exhibit significantly less water-mass freshening than those in the other two southern basins. However, a decrease in the volume of the coldest, deepest waters is observed throughout the entire Southern Ocean.

	abstract = {Abstract. Ocean-induced basal melting is responsible for much of
the Amundsen Sea Embayment ice loss in recent decades, but the total
magnitude and spatiotemporal evolution of this melt is poorly constrained.
To address this problem, we generated a record of high-resolution digital
elevation models (DEMs) for Pine Island Glacier (PIG) using commercial
sub-meter satellite stereo imagery and integrated additional 2002–2015
DEM and altimetry data. We implemented a Lagrangian elevation change (Dh∕Dt)
framework to estimate ice shelf basal melt rates at 32–256 m resolution. We
describe this methodology and consider basal melt rates and elevation change
over the PIG ice shelf and lower catchment from 2008 to 2015. We document
the evolution of Eulerian elevation change (dh∕dt) and upstream propagation of
thinning signals following the end of rapid grounding line retreat around
2010. Mean full-shelf basal melt rates for the 2008–2015 period were
∼82–93 Gt yr−1, with ∼200–250 m yr−1 basal melt
rates within large channels near the grounding line, ∼10–30 m yr−1 over the main shelf, and ∼0–10 m yr−1 over the North shelf and
South shelf, with the notable exception of a small area with rates of
∼50–100 m yr−1 near the grounding line of a fast-flowing
tributary on the South shelf. The observed basal melt rates show excellent
agreement with, and provide context for, in situ basal melt-rate observations. We
also document the relative melt rates for kilometer-scale basal channels and keels
at different locations on the ice shelf and consider implications for ocean
circulation and heat content. These methods and results offer new indirect
observations of ice–ocean interaction and constraints on the processes
driving sub-shelf melting beneath vulnerable ice shelves in West Antarctica.},

A sensitivity study in which the radiation code is modified so that cloud liquid and ice do not emit, absorb, or reflect radiation is used to identify cloud impacts beyond the cloud radiative effect. It is found that Arctic mixed-phase stratocumuli are not produced in the sensitivity experiment, highlighting that cloud radiative fluxes are required to maintain the clouds. A number of feedbacks are found that damp the warming effect of the clouds. Thin mixed-phase clouds increase the downward longwave fluxes by 100 W m−2, but upward daytime surface longwave fluxes increase by 20 W m−2 (60 W m−2 at night) and net shortwave fluxes decrease by 40 W m−2 (partially due to a 0.05 increase in surface albedo), leaving only 40 W m−2 available for melt.

Comparison between geophysically and laboratory-based treatments of ice–ocean interface thermodynamics shows reasonable agreement between calculated melt rates, except where steep basal slopes and relatively high ocean temperatures are present. Results are especially sensitive to the poorly known drag coefficient, highlighting the need for additional field experiments to constrain its value. These experiments also suggest that if the ice–ocean interface near the grounding line is steeper than some threshold, further steepening of the slope may drive higher entrainment that limits buoyancy, slowing the plume and reducing melting; if confirmed, this will provide a stabilizing feedback on ice sheets under some circumstances.},

Of these glaciers, 87\% have retreated and a clear boundary between mean advance and retreat has migrated progressively southward. The pattern is broadly compatible with retreat driven by atmospheric warming, but the rapidity of the migration suggests that this may not be the sole driver of glacier retreat in this region.
Most of the 244 marine glaciers around the Antarctic Peninsula have retreated rapidly over the past 60 years, in part because of increased atmospheric temperatures there.

	abstract = {Diffusive convection–favorable thermohaline staircases are observed directly beneath George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctica. A thermohaline staircase is one of the most pronounced manifestations of double-diffusive convection. Cooling and freshening of the ocean by melting ice produces cool, freshwater above the warmer, saltier water, the water mass distribution favorable to a type of double-diffusive convection known as diffusive convection. While the vertical distribution of water masses can be susceptible to diffusive convection, none of the observations beneath ice shelves so far have shown signals of this process and its effect on melting ice shelves is uncertain. The melt rate of ice shelves is commonly estimated using a parameterization based on a three-equation model, which assumes a fully developed, unstratified turbulent flow over hydraulically smooth surfaces. These prerequisites are clearly not met in the presence of a thermohaline staircase. The basal melt rate is estimated by applying an existing heat flux parameterization for diffusive convection in conjunction with the measurements of oceanic conditions at one site beneath George VI Ice Shelf. These estimates yield a possible range of melt rates between 0.1 and 1.3 m yr
              −1

	abstract = {The basal melting of George VI Ice Shelf into the unusually warm underlying water represents a major oceanographic feature in the waters off the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Limited temperature, salinity and other data have previously been available from the northern ice front of the ice shelf and a mechanism has been proposed for the circulation and melting there. A synoptic dataset from the northern ice front has now been obtained by a continuously measuring CTD probe. The cross-sectional profiles prepared from these data support the suggested model and show that this circulation can account for two thirds of the basal ice melt required for mass balance of the ice shelf. Further measurements, with the profiling CTD instrument, with sample bottles and reversing thermometers, and with an Aanderaa RCM4 current meter, have extended coverage to the southern ice front. The oceanographic regime there is similar to that in the north below 500 m and it appears that communication occurs between the northern and southern regions at this depth. Clear evidence of basal melting is observed in the T-S characteristics at the southern ice front but the waters of the region are not described by a unique T-S curve as they are in the north. More detailed investigation of the southern area is required before estimates of the actual melt rates for the entire ice shelf will be possible.},

	abstract = {In the vicinity of the Antarctic Peninsula observations show diminishing sea ice and a rapid warming of atmosphere and ocean. These changes have led to the collapse of ice shelves and retreat, acceleration, and thinning of inland ice. However, ocean observations in the center of the nearby Bellingshausen Sea are spatially and temporally coarse. In this study, ocean and sea ice models forced by atmospheric reanalyses are used to investigate this data gap by simulating processes in the Bellingshausen Sea for the years 1979–2007. The model suggests flow features in the region and predicts the basal melting of local ice shelves. Modeled ocean conditions are found to be less variable than in the nearby Amundsen Sea, which is situated closer to foci of annual and interannual atmospheric variability. Melt rates beneath George VI Ice Shelf are investigated in detail, concluding that the ice shelf may have been melting out of balance (and therefore thinning) for decades. The melt rate contains significant interannual variability that the model links to variation in sea ice conditions offshore of the southern end of the ice shelf. This stands in contrast to the Amundsen Sea, where models suggest that ice shelf melting is controlled by variable transport of Circumpolar Deep Water onto the continental shelf.},

	abstract = {Ocean tides are the main source of high-frequency variability in the vertical and horizontal motion of ice sheets near their marine margins. Floating ice shelves, which occupy about three quarters of the perimeter of Antarctica and the termini of four outlet glaciers in northern Greenland, rise and fall in synchrony with the ocean tide. Lateral motion of floating and grounded portions of ice sheets near their marine margins can also include a tidal component. These tide-induced signals provide insight into the processes by which the oceans can affect ice sheet mass balance and dynamics. In this review, we summarize in situ and satellite-based measurements of the tidal response of ice shelves and grounded ice, and spatial variability of ocean tide heights and currents around the ice sheets. We review sensitivity of tide heights and currents as ocean geometry responds to variations in sea level, ice shelf thickness, and ice sheet mass and extent. We then describe coupled ice-ocean models and analytical glacier models that quantify the effect of ocean tides on lower-frequency ice sheet mass loss and motion. We suggest new observations and model developments to improve the representation of tides in coupled models that are used to predict future ice sheet mass loss and the associated contribution to sea level change. The most critical need is for new data to improve maps of bathymetry, ice shelf draft, spatial variability of the drag coefficient at the ice-ocean interface, and higher-resolution models with improved representation of tidal energy sinks.},

The wide gap notwithstanding, the two subjects have much in common. Keeling and Whorf have proposed that the millennial climate variability is associated with high-frequency tidal forcing extending into the 10-octave gap by some nonlinear process. Here, the authors distinguish between two quite distinct processes for generating low frequencies: (i) the ‘‘traditional’’ analogy with eclipse cycles associated with near coincidence of the appropriate orbital alignment of the Sun, the Moon, and Earth, and (ii) sum and differences of tidal frequencies and their harmonics producing low beat frequencies. The ﬁrst process is associated with long time intervals between extreme tides, but the events are of short duration and only marginally higher than conventional high tides. With proper nonlinearities, (ii) can lead to low-frequency tidal forcing. A few candidate frequencies in the centurial and millennial band are found, which prominently include the Keeling and Whorf forcing at 1795 yr. This is conﬁrmed by a numerical experiment with a computer-generated tidal time series of 275 000 yr. Tidal forcing is very weak and an unlikely candidate for millennial variability; the Keeling and Whorf proposal is considered as the most likely among unlikely candidates.},

These represent the warmest water observed at any ice shelf front in the Amundsen Sea. Mean currents within the warm bottom layer of 18?20 cm/s imply an advection time scale of 7 days from shelf break to ice shelf front. Zonal wind stress at the shelf break affects heat content at the ice shelf front on weekly to monthly time scales. Our 2-year mooring records also evince that upwelling over the shelf break controls thermocline depth on subannual to annual time scales.},

Using satellite radar interferometry from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, we detect a 5.4 ± 0.3 km grounding line retreat between 1996 and 2017–2018. A novel reconstruction of the glacier bed topography indicates that the retreat proceeds on the western flank along a previously unknown 5 km wide, 1,800 m deep trough, deepening to 3,400 m below sea level. On the eastern flank, the grounding line is stabilized by a 10 km wide ridge. At tidal frequencies, the grounding line extends over a several kilometer-wide grounding zone, enabling warm ocean water to melt ice at critical locations for glacier stability. If warm, modified Circumpolar Deep Water reaches the sub-ice-shelf cavity and continues to melt ice at a rate exceeding balance conditions, the potential exists for Denman Glacier to retreat irreversibly into the deepest, marine-based basin in Antarctica.},

The basal melt (or possible shelf thickening) rates for the ice shelf are calculated by balancing the accumulation with calving and melting. We calculate an average equilibrium melt rate for the ice shelf of 2 m a −1. If the ice shelf is in mass balance it alone provides 53 km3a −1 melt from its base compared to a total for Antarctica of only 320 km3a −1.
The mean oxygen isotope composition of recent accumulation on the catchment is determined by using accumulation and isotope data, supplemented by temperature measurements and a close empirical relationship between isotope ratio and temperature. The catchment has a mean isotope ratio of −20.8‰ relative to SMOW.
Oceanographic work has previously shown that the sea-water under the ice shelf at the north of George VI Sound is Warm Deep Water modified by melting ice. The melting ice has an isotope ratio of −20.3‰. The good agreement in isotope ratios suggest that the melting ice is from the catchment and because the basal ice of George VI Ice Shelf represents accumulation over the last few millennia the implication is that there has been no systematic change in the isotope composition of the accumulation during this period. This implies no secular change in either the elevation or the climatic temperature of this part of the ice sheet.

Résumé
Des estimations glaciologiques de l’alimentation en glace pour le George VI Ice Shelf sont obtenues en sommant l’accumulation sur le bassin. La fonte basale du shelf (ou son amincissement possible) est calculée en faisant le bilan de l’accumulation, du vélage et de la fonte. On obtient un taux de foute moyen d’équilibre pour le shelf de 2 m a−1. Si le shelf de glace est équilibré en bilan, rien que cela conduit à une fonte basale de 53 km3a−1 à comparer aux 320 km3a−1 seulement de l’ensemble de l’Antarctique.
La teneur moyenne en isotope d’oxygène des accumulations récentes sur le bassin est déterminée par les données d’accumulation et d’isotope jointes à des relevés de température et une très bonne relation empirique température - taux d’isotope. Le taux moyen d’isotope du bassin, relatif au SMOW, est de − 20,8‰.
Des travaux océanographiques ont antérieurement montré que l’eau de mer sous le shelf au nord de la George VI Sound est de l’eau chaude profonde modifiée par la fusion de la glace. L’eau de fusion a une teneur en isotope de − 20,3‰. La bonne concordance des teneurs en isotope suggère que la glace qui fond provient du bassin et du fait que la glace basale du shelf représente l’accumulation sur les quelques derniers millénaries, cela a pour conséquence qu’il n’y a pas eu de changement systématique dans la teneur en isotope de l’accumulation pendant cette période. Cela implique aucun changement séculaire, que ce soit dans l’altitude ou bien dans la température climatique de cette partie de la calotte de glace.

Zusammenfassung
Glaziologische Abschätzungen des Eisnachschubs zum George VI Ice Shelf werden durch Integration der Akkumulation über das Einzugsgebiet gewonnen. Die Schmelz- oder möglicherweise Zuwachsraten an der Unterseite des Schelfeises werden aus der Bilanz zwischen Akkumulation bzw. Kalben und Schmelzen berechnet. Es ergibt sich eine mittlere Gleichgewichtsschmelzrate von 2 m pro Jahr für das Schelfeis. Wenn das Schelfeis sich im Massengleichgewicht befindet, liefert es allein 53 km3 Schmelzwasser pro Jahr von seiner Unterseite, verglichen mit nur 320 km3 pro Jahr für ganz Antarktika.
Die mittlere Zusammensetzung an Sauerstoffisotopen der jüngeren Akkumulation im Einzugsgebiet wird bestimmt aus Akkumulations- und Isotopendaten, ergänzt durch Temperaturmessungen und eine empirische Beziehung zwischen dem Isotopenverhältnis und der Temperatur. Das Einzugsgebiet hat ein mittleres Isotopenverhältnis von −20,8‰ relativ zu SMOW.
Ozeanographische Arbeiten haben früher gezeigt, dass das Meerwasser unter dem Schelfeis im Norden des George VI Sound warmes Tiefenwasser, verändert durch schmelzendes Eis, ist. Das schmelzende Eis hat ein Isotopen-verhältnis von −20,3‰. Die gute Übereinstimmung der Isotopenverhältnisse lassen vermuten, dass das schmelzende Eis aus dem Einzugsgebiet stammt. Da das Eis an der Unterseite des George VI Ice Shelf die Akkumulation über einige der letzten Jahrtausende darstellt, ergibt sich die unerwartete Folgerung, dass in dieser Zeitspanne keine systematische Änderung in der Isotopenzusammensetzung der Akkumulation eingetreten ist. Dies würde bedeuten, dass weder die Höhe noch die klimatische Temperatur dieses Teiles des Eisschildes sich langfristig geändert hat.},

	abstract = {George VI Ice Shelf floats on warmer water than any other ice shelf in the Antarctic. Profiles of temperature (T) and salinity (S) taken in the vicinity of the northern ice front show a linear T/S dependence confirming a thermodynamic model of melting in Circumpolar Deep Water and indicate that thermohaline convection is the principal mixing process. Oxygen isotope (δ) profiles demonstrate that the melting ice has a δ value of −20\%/°° with respect to Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW). An integration of accumulation and isotope data over the ice catchment confirms that this is the mean isotope ratio of present-day accumulation. Since the basal ice is formed from accumulation over several millennia, it is unlikely that there has been any significant net climatic change in the Antarctic Peninsula over this period. Both summer and long-term measurements show that currents are weak except at the western margin of the northern ice front where a northward jet conveys some 0.05×106 m3 s−1 of water into Marguerite Bay. This leads to a simple circulation model for the northern part of George VI Sound; Circumpolar Deep Water is advected under the ice shelf at depth, upwells transferring heat which melts the ice and then collects in a northward outflow gathered to the west by Coriolis force. The circulation is driven by the melting process which causes the upwelling of warmer water from greater depths. A salt and energy balance shows that the outflow conveys some 16 km3 yr−1 of ice melt. It is inferred from T/S profiles that the northern circulation penetrates at least 160 km south but not so far as the southern ice front in Ronne Entrance. These geographical limits constrain the basal melt to values between 1.1 and 3.6 m yr−1 A calculation balancing accumulation over the catchment with ice losses from the ice shelf predicts a basal melt of 2.1 m yr−1 If the ice shelf is in equilibrium it alone supplies 53 km3 yr−1 of ice melt or about one-sixth of the total for Antarctica. Tidal height and current measurements both show a highly suppressed M2 tide and the presence of “shallow water” constituents. A nonlinear ice shelf reponse to tidal forcing is suspected.},

Colder and more saline water in the lower part of this layer leads to in-situ freezing of fresher water lying above it. Below 155 m depth, the water temperature and salinity are linearly related by basal melting which is observed elsewhere under the ice shelf. The surface ice shows areas of deformation and deposits of subglacial rock debris which may result from upward particle paths in the area. The raising of subglacial rock debris on to the ice surface may provide a mechanism for the transport of erratics across the ice shelf to Alexander Island from the base of Palmer Land glaciers.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The geometry of the sea floor beyond Thwaites Glacier (TG) is a major control on the routing of warm ocean waters towards the ice stream’s grounding zone, which has led to increased mass loss through sub-ice-shelf melting and resulting accelerated ice flow. Nearshore topographic highs act as pinning points for the Thwaites Ice Shelf and potentially provide barriers to warm water incursions. To date, few vessels have been able to access this area due to persistent sea-ice and iceberg cover. This critical data gap was addressed in 2019 during the first cruise of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) project, with more than 2000\&thinsp;km$^{\textrm{2}}$ of new multibeam echo-sounder data (MBES) were acquired offshore TG. Here, these data along with legacy MBES datasets are compiled to produce a set of standalone bathymetric grids for the inner Amundsen Sea shelf beyond both Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers. At TG, the bathymetry is dominated by a {\textgreater}\&thinsp;1200\&thinsp;m deep, structurally-controlled trough and discontinuous ridge, on which the Eastern Ice Shelf is pinned. The geometry and composition of the ridge varies spatially with some parts having distinctive flat-topped morphologies produced as their tops were planed-off by erosion at the base of the seaward-moving Thwaites Ice Shelf, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism for ice-shelf ungrounding. Knowing that this offshore area is a former bed for TG, we applied a novel spectral approach to investigate bed roughness and find that derived power spectra can be approximated using an inverse-square law, a result that is consistent with spectra for bed profiles from the modern TG. Using existing ice-flow theory, we also make a first assessment of the form drag (basal drag contribution) for ice flow over this topography. Ice flowing over the sea-floor troughs and ridges would have been affected by similarly high basal drag to that acting in the grounding zone today. We show that the sea-floor bathymetry is an analogue for extant bed areas of TG and that more can be gleaned from these 3D bathymetric datasets regarding the likely spatial variability of bed roughness and bed composition types underneath TG. Comparisons with existing regional bathymetric compilations for the area show that high-frequency (finer than 5\&thinsp;km) bathymetric variability beyond Antarctic ice shelves can only be resolved by observations such as MBES and that without these data calculations of the capacity of bathymetric troughs, and thus oceanic heat flux, may be significantly underestimated. This work meets the requirements of recent numerical ice-sheet and ocean modelling studies that have recognised the need for accurate and high-resolution bathymetry to determine warm water routing to the grounding zone and, ultimately, for predicting glacier retreat behaviour.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we show, using a combination of remote sensing observations, regional climate model outputs, reanalysis data, and artificial neural networks, that unprecedented atmospheric conditions (1948–2019) occurring in the summer of 2019 over Greenland promoted new record or close-to-record values of surface mass balance (SMB), runoff, and snowfall. Specifically, runoff in 2019 ranked second within the 1948–2019 period (after 2012) and first in terms of surface mass balance negative anomaly for the hydrological year 1 September 2018–31 August 2019. The summer of 2019 was characterized by an exceptional persistence of anticyclonic conditions that, in conjunction with low albedo associated with reduced snowfall in summer, enhanced the melt–albedo feedback by promoting the absorption of solar radiation and favored advection of warm, moist air along the western portion of the ice sheet towards the north, where the surface melt has been the highest since 1948. The analysis of the frequency of daily 500\&thinsp;hPa geopotential heights obtained from artificial neural networks shows that the total number of days with the five most frequent atmospheric patterns that characterized the summer of 2019 was 5 standard deviations above the 1981–2010 mean, confirming the exceptional nature of the 2019 season over Greenland.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract One of the key components of Antarctica's harsh climate is its renowned katabatic winds, which are among the fiercest surface winds on Earth. Caused primarily by strong surface cooling over the sloping ice surface, these semipermanent winds result primarily from the strong surface temperature inversion and associated temperature deficit between the surface layer and the free atmosphere aloft. Katabatic winds exert a strong effect on the mass budget of the Antarctic ice sheet by affecting snowdrift (sublimation) and by (partially) regulating the net atmospheric moisture transports toward the Antarctic. It has been suggested that greenhouse warming may lead to reduced surface cooling and weakened katabatic winds. This is tested by using a global climate model (EC-Earth) in prescribed sea surface temperature simulations of the present-day (2002?2006) and future (2094?2098) climates. Because simulated topographically induced katabatic winds are likely to depend on the model grid, we employ two model resolutions: (1) T159L62 ({\textasciitilde}100?km, 62 vertical levels) and (2) T799L91 ({\textasciitilde}20?km, 91 vertical levels). It is shown here that present-day surface winds over Antarctica in high resolution are generally stronger than in low resolution, especially in the escarpment region with its steep orography. Simulated surface winds are generally underestimated with respect to observations, in particular the strongest winds (occurring over steep slopes), and especially in low resolution. The seasonal cycle in surface winds is simulated fairly accurately. Surface temperatures are also relatively well simulated (when corrected for elevation differences), especially in high resolution.},

In this study, the authors present results of a climate run at 5.5 km for the period 1979–2013, in which RACMO2.3 is forced by ERA-Interim atmospheric and ocean surface fields, using an updated AP surface topography. The model results are evaluated with near-surface temperature and wind measurements from 12 manned and automatic weather stations and vertical profiles from balloon soundings made at three stations. The seasonal cycle of near-surface temperature and wind is simulated well, with most biases still related to the limited model resolution. High-resolution climate maps of temperature and wind showing that the AP climate exhibits large spatial variability are discussed. Over the steep and high mountains of the northern AP, large west-to-east climate gradients exist, while over the gentle southern AP mountains the near-surface climate is dominated by katabatic winds. Over the flat ice shelves, where katabatic wind forcing is weak, interannual variability in temperature is largest. Finally, decadal trends of temperature and wind are presented, and it is shown that recently there has been distinct warming over the northwestern AP and cooling over the rest of the AP, related to changes in sea ice cover.},

Data from two test sites, a dedicated GPS tide gauge at the Onsala Space Observatory (OSO) in Sweden and the Friday Harbor GPS site of the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) in USA, are analyzed. The sea level results are compared to independently observed sea level data from nearby and in situ tide gauges. For OSO, the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) agreement is better than 5cm, while it is in the order of 10cm for Friday Harbor. The correlation coefficients are better than 0.97 for both sites. For OSO, the SNR-based results are also compared with results from a geodetic analysis of GPS data of a two receivers/antennae tide gauge installation. The SNR-based analysis results in a slightly worse RMS agreement with respect to the independent tide gauge data than the geodetic analysis (4.8cm and 4.0cm, respectively). However, it provides results even for rough sea surface conditions when the two receivers/antennae installation no longer records the necessary data for a geodetic analysis.},

How do glaciers flow over the ground underlying them? We know that friction, ice stream velocity, and water pressure at the ice bed all matter, but we still do not know how to represent the process over both hard beds (which are solid rock) and soft ones (composed of unconsolidated erosion products called till). Zoet and Iverson present experimental results describing how glacial ice moves over watersaturated till (see the Perspective by Minchew and Joughin). These observations should help to solve the long-standing problem of constructing a generalized slip law that combines the processes of hard-bedded sliding and bed deformation.
Science, this issue p. 76; see also p. 29
Slip of marine-terminating ice streams over beds of deformable till is responsible for most of the contribution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to sea level rise. Flow models of the ice sheet and till-bedded glaciers elsewhere require a law that relates slip resistance, slip velocity, and water pressure at the bed. We present results of experiments in which pressurized ice at its melting temperature is slid over a water-saturated till bed. Steady-state slip resistance increases with slip velocity owing to sliding of ice across the bed, but above a threshold velocity, till shears at its rate-independent Coulomb strength. These results motivate a generalized slip law for glacier-flow models that combines processes of hard-bedded sliding and bed deformation.
Experiments reveal how glacial slip over soft beds depends on velocity.

The ice thickness change rates are calculated in a Lagrangian reference frame to reduce the effects from advection of sharp vertical features, such as cracks and crevasses, that can saturate Eulerian-derived estimates. We use our method over different ice shelves in Antarctica, which vary in terms of size, repeat coverage from airborne altimetry, and dominant processes governing their recent changes. We find that the Larsen-C Ice Shelf is close to steady state over our observation period with spatial variations in ice thickness largely due to the flux divergence of the shelf. Firn and surface processes are responsible for some short-term variability in ice thickness of the Larsen-C Ice Shelf over the time period. The Wilkins Ice Shelf is sensitive to short-timescale coastal and upper-ocean processes, and basal melt is the dominant contributor to the ice thickness change over the period.

	abstract = {Abstract Ocean tides are the main source of high-frequency variability in the vertical and horizontal motion of ice sheets near their marine margins. Floating ice shelves, which occupy about three quarters of the perimeter of Antarctica and the termini of four outlet glaciers in northern Greenland, rise and fall in synchrony with the ocean tide. Lateral motion of floating and grounded portions of ice sheets near their marine margins can also include a tidal component. These tide-induced signals provide insight into the processes by which the oceans can affect ice sheet mass balance and dynamics. In this review, we summarize in situ and satellite-based measurements of the tidal response of ice shelves and grounded ice, and spatial variability of ocean tide heights and currents around the ice sheets. We review sensitivity of tide heights and currents as ocean geometry responds to variations in sea level, ice shelf thickness, and ice sheet mass and extent. We then describe coupled ice-ocean models and analytical glacier models that quantify the effect of ocean tides on lower-frequency ice sheet mass loss and motion. We suggest new observations and model developments to improve the representation of tides in coupled models that are used to predict future ice sheet mass loss and the associated contribution to sea level change. The most critical need is for new data to improve maps of bathymetry, ice shelf draft, spatial variability of the drag coefficient at the ice-ocean interface, and higher-resolution models with improved representation of tidal energy sinks.},

In this study, we analyze the response of outlet glaciers to different sources of climate forcing. We find that outlet glaciers have a characteristically different transient response to surface-mass-balance forcing applied over the interior than to oceanic forcing applied at the grounding line. A recently developed reduced model represents outlet glacier dynamics via two widely-separated response timescales: a fast response associated with grounding-zone dynamics, and a slow response of interior ice. The reduced model is shown to emulate the behavior of a more complex numerical model of ice flow. Together, these models demonstrate that ocean forcing first engages the fast, local response, and then the slow adjustment of interior ice, whereas surface-mass-balance forcing is dominated by the slow interior adjustment. We also demonstrate the importance of the timescales of stochastic forcing for assessing the natural variability of outlet glaciers, highlighting that decadal persistence in ocean variability can affect the behavior of outlet glaciers on centennial and longer timescales. Finally, we show that these transient responses have important implications for: attributing observed glacier changes to natural or anthropogenic influences; the future change already committed by past forcing; and the impact of past climate changes on the preindustrial glacier state, against which current and future anthropogenic influences are assessed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A common belief about tidal sedimentation is that tides are always larger near the equator and negligible at high latitudes. This belief appears to be based on equilibrium tidal theory that predicts the existence of two ocean–surface bulges centered at low latitudes; however, it is a misconception because this theory is a poor model for real-world tides. Instead, the tide behaves as a set of shallow-water waves that are guided around the world by the continents. Tidal ranges and tidal-current speeds increase as the tidal wave propagates onto and across continental shelves; especially large ranges and fast currents can occur in coastal embayments and in straits that join two larger bodies of water. Models of real-world tides today demonstrate that tides in shallow water (,100 m) have amplitude peaks at 508 N to 708 N and 508 S to 608 S that are associated with especially wide continental shelves and coastal embayments in which the tidal wave is close to resonance. The small tides characterizing most polar areas today are the result of local geomorphic features: the Arctic Ocean is too small to have its own tide and has only a small connection to the Atlantic Ocean that prevents effective northward propagation of the tidal wave, and Antarctica has narrow and deep continental shelves that do not accentuate the tide. Nevertheless, there are local areas in both the Arctic and Antarctic with favorable geomorphology that have macrotidal ranges. Thus, the latitudinal distribution of large tides is contingent on the plate-tectonic and sea-level history of the earth and changes over geologic time as the conﬁguration of the ocean basins and the geometry of the ﬂooded shelves change. The latitudinal variation of the strength of the Coriolis effect has a second-order inﬂuence on tidal dynamics, with the degree of tidal-range asymmetry across a basin potentially being larger at higher latitudes. The offshore extent of large coastal tidal ranges decreases at higher latitudes because the increased Coriolis effect leads to the tidal wave being more strongly banked-up against the shoreline. Diurnal, topographically trapped vorticity waves that can generate large tidal currents in shelf-edge water depths are also limited to middle to high latitudes. The presence of ice in polar areas also has an inﬂuence on tidal dynamics. Sea ice causes a small decrease in tidal range, whereas thick, ﬂoating ice shelves can cause dramatic increases in tidal range and tidal-current speeds, at least locally, as a result of the decrease in the cross-sectional area of the water beneath the ice shelves. Because coastal sedimentation is controlled by the relative importance of tidal currents and waves, the abundance of tide-dominated deposits might not reﬂect perfectly the latitudinal distribution of large tides. Thus, the small size of waves in the equatorial zone appears to cause preferential development of tide-dominated coastal zones near the equator, whereas wave dominance might be higher at midlatitudes because of the higher level of storminess, regardless of the latitudinal distribution of large tides.},

Since ship access to the Ross Sea is restricted by sea ice in winter, most upper ocean measurements have been acquired in summer. We report the first multiyear time series of temperature and salinity throughout the water column, obtained with autonomous profiling floats. Seven Apex floats were deployed in 2013 on the midcontinental shelf, and six Air-Launched Autonomous Micro Observer floats were deployed in late 2016, mostly near the ice shelf front. Between profiles, most floats were parked on the seabed to minimize lateral motion. Surface mixed layer temperatures, salinities, and depths, in winter were −1.8 °C, 34.34, and 250–500 m, respectively. Freshwater from sea ice melt in early December formed a shallow (20 m) surface mixed layer, which deepened to 50–80 m and usually warmed to above −0.5 °C by late January. Upper-ocean freshening continued throughout the summer, especially in the eastern Ross Sea and along the ice shelf front. This freshening requires substantial lateral advection that is dominated by inflow from melting of sea ice and ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea and by inputs from the Ross Ice Shelf. Changes in upper-ocean freshwater and heat content along the ice shelf front in summer affect cross-ice front advection, ice shelf melting, and calving processes that determine the rate of mass loss from the grounded Antarctic Ice Sheet in this sector.},

	abstract = {Recent studies show that the glaciers draining both the West Antarctic and the Greenland Ice Sheets are experiencing an accelerated ice loss, highlighting the possibility of large-scale ice sheet retreat and sea level rise in the coming centuries and millennia. These sea level changes would vary spatially and could significantly alter global tides as the latter are highly dependent on bathymetry (or water column thickness under ice shelves) and basin shape. This paper investigates how the principal semidiurnal (M2) tidal amplitudes and energy dissipation respond to the nonuniform sea level changes induced by complete ice sheet collapses. The sea level changes are calculated using gravitationally self-consistent sea level theory, and the tides are simulated using an established tidal model. Results from the simulations show global and spatially heterogeneous changes in tidal amplitudes. In addition, pronounced changes in tidal energy dissipation occur in both the open ocean and in shelf-seas, also altering the location of tidal mixing fronts. These changes have the potential to impact ocean mixing, and hence large-scale currents and climate patterns, and the contribution of shelf-sea to the global carbon cycle. The new results highlight the importance of considering changes in the tides in predictions of future climate and reconstructions of past climate phases such as the Last Interglacial.},

In mid-2013, an abrupt reversal occurred, and very little net ice loss occurred in the next 12–18 months. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and global positioning system (GPS) observations reveal that the spatial patterns of the sustained acceleration and the abrupt deceleration in mass loss are similar. The strongest accelerations tracked the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The negative phase of the NAO enhances summertime warming and insolation while reducing snowfall, especially in west Greenland, driving surface mass balance (SMB) more negative, as illustrated using the regional climate model MAR. The spatial pattern of accelerating mass changes reflects the geography of NAO-driven shifts in atmospheric forcing and the ice sheet’s sensitivity to that forcing.

	abstract = {In response to present-day ice mass loss on and near the Greenland Ice Sheet, steady crustal uplifts have been observed from the network of Global Positioning System (GPS) stations mounted on bedrock. In addition to the secular uplift trends, the GPS time series also show prominent annual variability. Here we examine the annual changes of the vertical displacements measured at two GPS stations (SRMP and UPVK) near Upernavik Isstrøm in western Greenland. We model elastic loading displacements due to various surface mass loading including three nonice components: atmospheric pressure, ocean bottom pressure, continental water storage, and one ice component, i.e., surface mass balance (SMB). We find that the contribution from atmospheric pressure changes can explain 46\% and 78\% of the annual amplitude observed in the GPS verticals at SRMP and UPVK, respectively. We also show that removing the predicted loading displacements due to SMB adversely increases the annual variance of the GPS residuals. However, using the GPS data alone, we cannot identify the exact cause(s) of this discrepancy because the annual loading displacements are sensitive to the SMB changes from over 85\% of the ice sheet area. Alternatively, by differencing vertical displacements between the two stations, we find a good agreement between the modeled differential SMB loading displacements and the GPS residuals after removing nonice components. Our study highlights the necessity of correcting for nonice loading contributions in the GPS measurements of crustal deformation to infer ice mass changes in Greenland at annual periods.},

Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is the ongoing response of the solid Earth to ice and ocean load changes occurring since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; {\textasciitilde}21 thousand years ago) and may be used to constrain the GrIS deglaciation history. We use data from the Greenland Global Positioning System network to directly measure GIA and estimate basin-wide mass changes since the LGM. Unpredicted, large GIA uplift rates of +12 mm/year are found in southeast Greenland. These rates are due to low upper mantle viscosity in the region, from when Greenland passed over the Iceland hot spot about 40 million years ago. This region of concentrated soft rheology has a profound influence on reconstructing the deglaciation history of Greenland. We reevaluate the evolution of the GrIS since LGM and obtain a loss of 1.5-m sea-level equivalent from the northwest and southeast. These same sectors are dominating modern mass loss. We suggest that the present destabilization of these marine-based sectors may increase sea level for centuries to come. Our new deglaciation history and GIA uplift estimates suggest that studies that use the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite mission to infer present-day changes in the GrIS may have erroneously corrected for GIA and underestimated the mass loss by about 20 gigatons/year.

	abstract = {We compare measurements of the turbulent and radiative surface energy fluxes from an automatic weather station (AWS) on Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctica with corresponding fluxes from three high-resolution atmospheric models over a 1 month period during austral summer. All three models produce a reasonable simulation of the (relatively small) turbulent energy fluxes at the AWS site. However, biases in the modeled radiative fluxes, which dominate the surface energy budget, are significant. There is a significant positive bias in net shortwave radiation in all three models, together with a corresponding negative bias in net longwave radiation. In two of the models, the longwave bias only partially offsets the positive shortwave bias, leading to an excessive amount of energy available for heating and melting the surface, while, in the third, the negative longwave bias exceeds the positive shortwave bias, leading to a deficiency in calculated surface melt. Biases in shortwave and longwave radiation are anticorrelated, suggesting that they both result from the models simulating too little cloud (or clouds that are too optically thin). We conclude that, while these models may be able to provide some useful information on surface energy fluxes, absolute values of modeled melt rate are significantly biased and should be used with caution. Efforts to improve model simulation of melt should initially focus on the radiative fluxes and, in particular, on the simulation of the clouds that control these fluxes.},

In this study, we used sequential Landsat images spanning 2005\&ndash;2018 to produce detailed maps of the ice flow velocities and surface features for the Scar Inlet Ice Shelf (SIIS). Our results indicate that the ice flow velocities for the SIIS and its tributary glaciers (Flask and Leppard Glaciers) have substantially increased since 2005. Surface features, such as rifts and crevasses, have also substantially increased in both scope and scale and are particularly evident in the region between the Leppard Glacier and the Jason Peninsula. Several indicators\&mdash;including the acceleration of ice flows, the rapid growth of major surface rifts, the heavily enhanced surface crevasses, and the dynamic position of the ice front\&mdash;point to the evolving instability of the SIIS. These same indicators describe the conditions for the LBIS leading up to its 2002 collapse. To date, however, the SIIS remains intact. The formation of fast ice supporting the ice shelf front, combined with moderate mean summer temperatures, may be preventing or delaying its collapse.},

The Aqua and Terra orbits and MODIS swath width, combined with frequent clear-sky conditions, lead to very high availability of quality-controlled observations: on average, hourly data are available 14 h per day at the grid points around the South Pole and more than 9 h over a large area of the Antarctic Plateau. Processed MODIS land surface temperatures, referred to hereinafter as MODIS \textit{T}$_{\textrm{s}}$ values, were compared with in situ hourly measurements of surface temperature collected over the entirety of the year 2009 by seven stations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and automatic weather stations (AWSs). In spite of an occasional failure in the detection of clouds, MODIS \textit{T}$_{\textrm{s}}$ values exhibit a good performance, with a bias ranging from −1.8 to 0.1 °C and errors ranging from 2.2 to 4.8 °C root mean square at the five stations located on the plateau. These results show that MODIS \textit{T}$_{\textrm{s}}$ values can be used as a precise and accurate reference to test other surface temperature data sets. Here, we evaluate the performance of surface temperature in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis known as ERA-Interim reanalysis. During conditions detected as cloud free by MODIS, ERA-Interim shows a widespread warm bias in Antarctica in every season, ranging from +3 to +6 °C on the plateau. This confirms a recent study which showed that the largest discrepancies in 2 m air temperature between ERA-Interim and the global temperature data set HadCRUT4 compiled by the Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit occur in Antarctica. A comparison with in situ surface temperature shows that this bias is not strictly limited to clear-sky conditions. A detailed comparison with stand-alone simulations by the Crocus snowpack model, forced by ERA-Interim, and with the ERA-Interim/land simulations, shows that the warm bias may be due primarily to an overestimation of the surface turbulent fluxes in very stable conditions. Numerical experiments with Crocus show that a small change in the parameterization of the effects of stability on the surface exchange coefficients can significantly impact the snow surface temperature. The ERA-Interim warm bias appears to be likely due to an overestimation of the surface exchange coefficients under very stable conditions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The two AWSs are separated by about 70 km in the north–south direction, and both the near-surface meteorology and the SEB show similarities, although small differences in all components (most notably the melt flux) can be seen. The impact of subsurface absorption of shortwave radiation on melt and snow temperature is significant, and discussed. In winter, longwave cooling of the surface is entirely compensated by a downward turbulent transport of sensible heat. In summer, the positive net radiative flux is compensated by melt, and quite frequently by upward turbulent diffusion of heat and moisture, leading to sublimation and weak convection over the ice shelf. The month of November 2010 is highlighted, when strong westerly flow over the Antarctic Peninsula led to a dry and warm föhn wind over the ice shelf, resulting in warm and sunny conditions. Under these conditions the increase in shortwave and sensible heat fluxes is larger than the decrease of net longwave and latent heat fluxes, providing energy for significant melt.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Studies of sea level during previous interglacials provide insight into the stability of polar ice sheets in the face of global climate change. Commonly, these studies correct ancient sea-level highstands for the contaminating effect of isostatic adjustment associated with past ice age cycles, and interpret the residuals as being equivalent to the peak eustatic sea level associated with excess melting, relative to present day, of ancient polar ice sheets. However, the collapse of polar ice sheets produces a distinct geometry, or fingerprint, of sea-level change, which must be accounted for to accurately infer peak eustatic sea level from site-specific residual highstands. To explore this issue, we compute fingerprints associated with the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet, West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and marine sectors of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in order to isolate regions that would have been subject to greater-than-eustatic sea-level change for all three cases. These fingerprints are more robust than those associated with modern melting events, when applied to infer eustatic sea level, because: (1) a significant collapse of polar ice sheets reduces the sensitivity of the computed fingerprints to uncertainties in the geometry of the melt regions; and (2) the sea-level signal associated with the collapse will dominate the signal from steric effects. We evaluate these fingerprints at a suite of sites where sea-level records from interglacial marine isotopes stages (MIS) 5e and 11 have been obtained. Using these results, we demonstrate that previously discrepant estimates of peak eustatic sea level during MIS5e based on sea-level markers in Australia and the Seychelles are brought into closer accord.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Ocean-induced melting below ice shelves is one of the dominant drivers for mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet at present. An appropriate representation of sub-shelf melt rates is therefore essential for model simulations of marine-based ice sheet evolution. Continental-scale ice sheet models often rely on simple melt-parameterizations, in particular for long-term simulations, when fully coupled ice–ocean interaction becomes computationally too expensive. Such parameterizations can account for the influence of the local depth of the ice-shelf draft or its slope on melting. However, they do not capture the effect of ocean circulation underneath the ice shelf. Here we present the Potsdam Ice-shelf Cavity mOdel (PICO), which simulates the vertical overturning circulation in ice-shelf cavities and thus enables the computation of sub-shelf melt rates consistent with this circulation. PICO is based on an ocean box model that coarsely resolves ice shelf cavities and uses a boundary layer melt formulation. We implement it as a module of the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) and evaluate its performance under present-day conditions of the Southern Ocean. We identify a set of parameters that yield two-dimensional melt rate fields that qualitatively reproduce the typical pattern of comparably high melting near the grounding line and lower melting or refreezing towards the calving front. PICO captures the wide range of melt rates observed for Antarctic ice shelves, with an average of about 0.1\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}m a$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} for cold sub-shelf cavities, for example, underneath Ross or Ronne ice shelves, to 16\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}m a$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} for warm cavities such as in the Amundsen Sea region.

After accounting for simulation drift, which in the LE is sizable, the DSL FR is found to be complex, both in space and time. Its evolving character is suggested to arise from both the diversity and transient evolution of climate forcing agents and the slow adjustment timescales of the intermediate and deep oceans. Nonetheless, various intervals of spatially coherent change simulated for the recent past and near future are identified, and their characteristics and associated driving mechanisms are identified and discussed. The mid- to late-20th century DSL FR is characterized by an hemispherically asymmetric pattern of change, with depressed rates of rise in the northern oceans. There is also a dipole of change in the Southern Ocean caused by changes in near-surface zonal winds. Through the late 20th and early 21st centuries, a different pattern of rise emerges with elevated rates in the tropics and depressed rates at high latitudes. Zonal and interbasin variations characterize both intervals and involve the pattern and depth of anomalous ocean heat content storage and spatial contrasts in the expansion coefficient tied mainly to base state temperature, with greater rates of rise in warm regions per unit warming. The relative roles of surface flux and ocean convergence anomalies are examined.},

Here we combine more than three decades of remotely sensed observational products of outlet glacier velocity, elevation, and front position changes over the full ice sheet. We compare decadal variability in discharge and calving front position and find that increased glacier discharge was due almost entirely to the retreat of glacier fronts, rather than inland ice sheet processes, with a remarkably consistent speedup of 4–5\% per km of retreat across the ice sheet. We show that widespread retreat between 2000 and 2005 resulted in a step-increase in discharge and a switch to a new dynamic state of sustained mass loss that would persist even under a decline in surface melt.},

The net effect of these competing factors is a significant Surface Mass Balance (SMB) loss of \&minus;7.2\&plusmn;5.1 km$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;2}}$. The contribution of changes in the net water vapour flux (+0.02\&plusmn;0.09 km$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;2}}$) and rainfall (+0.2\&plusmn;0.2 km$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;2}}$) to the SMB variability is negligible. The meltwater supply has increased because the GrIS surface has been warming up +2.4\&deg;C since 1979. Sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and net solar radiation have not varied significantly over the last three decades. However, the simulated downward infrared flux has increased by 9.3 W m$^{\textrm{\&minus;2}}$ since 1979. The natural climate variability (e.g. the North Atlantic Oscillation) does not explain these changes. The recent global warming, due to the greenhouse gas concentration increase induced by human activities, could be a cause of these changes. The doubling of surface meltwater flux into the ocean over the period 1979\&ndash;2006 suggests that the overall ice sheet mass balance has been increasingly negative, given the likely meltwater-induced acceleration of outlet glaciers. This study suggests that increased melting overshadows over an increased accumulation in a warming scenario and that the GrIS is likely to keep losing mass in the future. An enduring GrIS melting will probably affect in the future an certain effect on the stability of the thermohaline circulation and the global sea level rise.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Laws of snow metamorphism have been introduced in a numerical model which simulates the evolution of temperature, density and liquid-water profiles of snow cover as a function of weather conditions.
To establish these laws, the authors have summarized previous studies on temperature gradient and on wet-snow metamorphism and they have also conducted metamorphism experiments on dry or wet fresh-snow samples. An original formalism was developed to allow a description of snow with parameters evolving continuously throughout time.
The introduction of laws of metamorphism has improved significantly the derivation of the settlement of internal layers and of snow-covered albedo, which depend on the simulated stratigraphy, i.e. the type and size of snow grains of different layers of the snow cover.
The model was tested during a whole winter season without any re-initialization. Comparison between the simulated characteristics of the snow cover and the observations made in the field are described in detail. The model proved itself to be very efficient in simulating accurately the evolution of the snow-cover stratigraphy throughout the whole winter season.},

	abstract = {In the present work, a numerical model that calculates the surface energy blance, mass balance and temperature in the uppermost 25 m of ice at a single location on a glacier is presented. The model is forced by five “basic” meteorological elements: air temperature and humidity, wind speed, cloud amount and precipitation. The model was developed for studies of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Parameterizations of the surface energy fluxes were optimised with data mainly from the ETH Camp, West Greenland (1155 m a.s.l.). The model was tested on data collected during the summer of 1990 in the ETH Camp. In this case measurements of the radiative fluxes could be used. A reasonable fit between measurements and calculations of mass balance and englacial temperature could be obtained. The energy balance of this summer is discussed. In a second application, the annual cycle of the energy and mass balance and the englacial temperature at the location of the ETH Camp was simulated. In this case long term average values of the input variables were estimated from measurements at other locations and the radiative fluxes were computed with the parameterizations. The effect of model uncertainties on the calculated mass balance and 10 m ice temperature is discussed. The energy balance and the relation between air and ice temperature are analysed. The uncertainty in the calculated ablation is so large (500–1000 mm w.e./yr) that the contribution of ablation on the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea-level rise cannot be calculated with sufficient accuracy (i.e. 60 mm w.e./yr) with this kind of model. However, the model should be appropriate for the determination of the sensitivity of ablation to climate change. It is predicted that at the ETH Camp the mass balance will decrease by 610 mm w.e./yr after a temperature increase of 1°C.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of surface meltwater on ice shelves can lead to the formation of melt lakes. Melt lakes have been implicated in ice shelf collapse; Antarctica's Larsen B Ice Shelf was observed to have a large amount of surface melt lakes present preceding its collapse in 2002. Such collapse can affect ocean circulation and temperature, cause habitat loss and contribute to sea level rise through the acceleration of tributary glaciers. We present a mathematical model of a surface melt lake on an idealized ice shelf. The model incorporates a calculation of the ice shelf surface energy balance, heat transfer through the firn, the production and percolation of meltwater into the firn, the formation of ice lenses, and the development and refreezing of surface melt lakes. The model is applied to the Larsen C Ice Shelf, where melt lakes have been observed. This region has warmed several times the global average over the last century and the Larsen C firn layer could become saturated with meltwater by the end of the century. When forced with weather station data, our model produces surface melting, meltwater accumulation, and melt lake development consistent with observations. We examine the sensitivity of lake formation to uncertain parameters and provide evidence of the importance of processes such as lateral meltwater transport. We conclude that melt lakes impact surface melt and firn density and warrant inclusion in dynamic-thermodynamic models of ice shelf evolution within climate models, of which our model could form the basis for the thermodynamic component.},

We forced eight firn-densification models and one seasonal-snow model in six different experiments by imposing step changes in temperature and accumulation-rate boundary conditions; all of the boundary conditions were chosen to simulate firn densification in cold, dry environments. While the intended application of the participating models varies, they are describing the same physical system and should in principle yield the same solutions. The firn models all produce plausible depth-density profiles, but the model outputs in both steady state and transient modes differ for quantities that are of interest in ice core and altimetry research. These differences demonstrate that firn-densification models are incorrectly or incompletely representing physical processes. We quantitatively characterize the differences among the results from the various models. For example, we find depth-integrated porosity is unlikely to be inferred with confidence from a firn model to better than 2 m in steady state at a specific site with known accumulation rate and temperature. Firn Model Intercomparison Experiment can provide a benchmark of results for future models, provide a basis to quantify model uncertainties and guide future directions of firn-densification modeling.},

Thus temperature and salinity can be fitted by exponential-like solutions [к · d2/dz2 − w · d/dz] T,S = 0, with к/w ≈ 1 km the appropriate “scale height.” For Carbon 14 a decay term must be included, [ ] 14C = μ 14C; a fitting of the solution to the observed 14C distribution yields (ifк/щ2≈ 200 years for then appropriate “scale time,” and permits ω and к to be separately determined. Using the foregoing values, the upward flux of Radium in deep water is found to be roughly 1·5 × 10−1 g cm−1 sec−1, as compared to 3 × 10−21 g cm−2 sec sedimentary measurements by Goldberg and Koide (1963). Oxygen consumption is computed at 0·004 (ml/l) year−1. The vertical distributions of T,S, 14C and O2 are consistent with the corresponding south-north gradients in the deep Pacific, provided there is an average northward drift of at leat a few millimetres per second. How can one meaningfully interpret the inferred rates of upwelling and diffusion? The annual freezing of 2·1 × 1019 g of Antarctic pack ice is associated with bottom water formation in the ration 43 : 1, yielding and estimated 4 × 1020g year−1 of Pacific bottom water ω = 1·2 cm day−1 implies 6 × 1020g year−1. I have attemped, wiothout much success, to interpret к froma variety of viewpoints: from mixing along the ocean boundaries, from thermodynamic and biological processes, and from internal tides. Following the work of Cox and Sandstrom (1962), it is found that surface tides are scattered by the irregular bottom into modes with an associated energy flux of 4 × 10−6 ergs g−1 (one sixth total tidal dissipation). Such modes can produce shear instability in the Richardson sence. It is found that internal tides provides a marginal but not impossible mechanism for turbulent diffusion in the interior oceans.},

We identify key contributors to model density and mass balance biases, including underestimated simulated fresh snow density (which leads to underestimation of density in the top 1 m of snow by 10\%). In areas undergoing frequent melting, positive density biases (of 7\% in the top 1 m, and 10\% between 1 and 10 m) are likely associated with errors in representing meltwater production, retention, and refreezing.

We have developed the Community Firn Model (CFM), an open-source, modular model framework designed to simulate numerous physical processes in firn. The modules include firn densification, heat transport, meltwater percolation and refreezing, water isotope diffusion, and firn-air diffusion. The CFM is designed so that new modules can be added with ease. In this paper, we first describe the CFM and its modules. We then demonstrate the CFM's usefulness in two model applications that utilize two of its novel aspects. The CFM currently has the ability to run any of 13 previously published firn densification models, and in the first application we compare those models' results when they are forced with regional climate model outputs for Summit, Greenland. The results show that the models do not agree well (spread greater than 10\&thinsp;\%) when predicting depth-integrated porosity, firn age, or the trend in surface elevation change. In the second application, we show that the CFM's coupled firn-air and firn densification models can simulate noble gas records from an ice core better than a firn-air model alone.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, the ocean cavity beneath it, and the Weddell Sea that bounds it, form an important part of the global climate system by modulating ice discharge from the Antarctic Ice Sheet and producing cold dense water masses that feed the global thermohaline circulation. A prerequisite for modeling the ice sheet and oceanographic processes within the cavity is an accurate knowledge of the sub-ice sheet bedrock elevation, but beneath the ice shelf where airborne radar cannot penetrate, bathymetric data are sparse. This paper presents new seismic point measurements of cavity geometry from a particularly poorly sampled region south of Berkner Island that connects the Filchner and Ronne ice shelves. An updated bathymetric grid formed by combining the new data with existing data sets reveals several new features. In particular, a sill running between Berkner Island and the mainland could alter ocean circulation within the cavity and change our understanding of paleo-ice stream flow in the region. Also revealed are deep troughs near the grounding lines of Foundation and Support Force ice streams, which provide access for seawater with melting potential. Running an ocean tidal model with the new bathymetry reveals large differences in tidal current velocities, both within the new gridded region and further afield, potentially affecting sub-ice shelf melt rates.},

	abstract = {More than half of Earth’s freshwater resources are held by the Antarctic Ice Sheet, which thus represents by far the largest potential source for global sea-level rise under future warming conditions1. Its long-term stability determines the fate of our coastal cities and cultural heritage. Feedbacks between ice, atmosphere, ocean, and the solid Earth give rise to potential nonlinearities in its response to temperature changes. So far, we are lacking a comprehensive stability analysis of the Antarctic Ice Sheet for different amounts of global warming. Here we show that the Antarctic Ice Sheet exhibits a multitude of temperature thresholds beyond which ice loss is irreversible. Consistent with palaeodata2 we find, using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model3–5, that at global warming levels around 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, West Antarctica is committed to long-term partial collapse owing to the marine ice-sheet instability. Between 6 and 9 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, the loss of more than 70 per cent of the present-day ice volume is triggered, mainly caused by the surface elevation feedback. At more than 10 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, Antarctica is committed to become virtually ice-free. The ice sheet’s temperature sensitivity is 1.3 metres of sea-level equivalent per degree of warming up to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, almost doubling to 2.4 metres per degree of warming between 2 and 6 degrees and increasing to about 10 metres per degree of warming between 6 and 9 degrees. Each of these thresholds gives rise to hysteresis behaviour: that is, the currently observed ice-sheet configuration is not regained even if temperatures are reversed to present-day levels. In particular, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet does not regrow to its modern extent until temperatures are at least one degree Celsius lower than pre-industrial levels. Our results show that if the Paris Agreement is not met, Antarctica’s long-term sea-level contribution will dramatically increase and exceed that of all other sources.},

The tide gauge records reveal significant shallow-water tidal effects, in particular compound and overtide amplitudes reaching 5 cm. The propagation of the tidal waves into the fjords depends strongly on local conditions and is in some cases accompanied by an amplification of the tidal amplitudes. The observed tidal signals are compared to the predictions of the global ocean tide model FES2004. At the outer coast, a good agreement is found. Inside the fjords, however, the model performs worse and tide gauge observations may still be indispensable when accurate tidal signals are required.},

	abstract = {Fjords form the gateway between the open ocean and the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) and consequently play a crucial role for the stability of the Ice Sheet. Hydrographic observations, especially with seasonal resolution, from these fjords are limited making it difficult to assess linkages between the fjord, coastal water masses, and freshwater discharge from GIS. Here we present a decade-long monthly hydrographic time series from a southwest Greenland fjord in direct contact with GIS. Our observations reveal significant temporal and spatial water mass variations related to coastal, glacial, and atmospheric dynamics. During winter, the fjord circulation is dominated by seasonal dense coastal inflows and the timing of these inflows determines intermediate and deepwater temperatures. During summer, runoff from GIS leads to a pronounced freshening of the fjord. In general, the fjord's seasonal circulation system damps the seasonal variation in temperature in the fjord. This leads to a seasonal temperature range in the intermediate layer in the inner part of the fjord that is half the observed range at the fjord entrance. Changes in mean water temperatures in the intermediate layer seem predominantly linked to local coastal water masses, where cold winter/warm summer events decrease/increase the mean water temperatures. Consequently, these events play an important role in heat transport toward glacier termini.},

The collapse of ice shelves that buttress11–13 the ice sheet accelerates ice flow and sea-level rise14–16. However, we do not know if and how much of the buttressing regions of Antarctica’s ice shelves are vulnerable to hydrofracture if inundated with water. Here we provide two lines of evidence suggesting that many buttressing regions are vulnerable. First, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to map the surface expressions of fractures in satellite imagery across all Antarctic ice shelves. Second, we developed a stability diagram of fractures based on linear elastic fracture mechanics to predict where basal and dry surface fractures form under current stress conditions. We find close agreement between the theoretical prediction and the DCNN-mapped fractures, despite limitations associated with detecting fractures in satellite imagery. Finally, we used linear elastic fracture mechanics theory to predict where surface fractures would become unstable if filled with water. Many regions regularly inundated with meltwater today are resilient to hydrofracture—stresses are low enough that all water-filled fractures are stable. Conversely, 60 ± 10 per cent of ice shelves (by area) both buttress upstream ice and are vulnerable to hydrofracture if inundated with water. The DCNN map confirms the presence of fractures in these buttressing regions. Increased surface melting17 could trigger hydrofracturing if it leads to water inundating the widespread vulnerable regions we identify. These regions are where atmospheric warming may have the largest impact on ice-sheet mass balance.},

Based on the static solutions, the coseismic slip distribution has an average slip of ∼6 m, a geodetic moment M0 of 1:5 × 1020 N·m, and a magnitude Mw of 7.4. A comparison of the static and kinematic results indicates that early (first 4 days) postseismic deformation was small compared to the coseismic deformation. The postseismic transient can be characterized by a logarithmic decay function with an average decay time constant of about 56 days. Substantial postseismic deformation is observed over the first ∼1:6 yrs of the earthquake and can be explained by afterslip on an adjacent segment of the fault to the southeast of the main coseismic rupture. Additional study will be needed to confirm whether afterslip is indeed the dominant mechanism causing postseismic motions or if another mechanism is also active.},

	abstract = {The Mw 7.5 Craig, Alaska, earthquake on 5 January 2013 was the second largest earthquake on the Queen Charlotte fault (QCF) in 40 yrs, representing the transform plate boundary between the Pacific and North American plates. Earthquake hazard along the QCF was known from historical earthquakes, but the absence of major earthquakes in the digitally instrumented era has limited studies of earthquakes. Here, we present an analysis of aftershocks of the Craig earthquake. We first use waveform cross correlation and double-difference relative relocation to relocate the aftershock catalog of the Alaska Earthquake Center (AEC). Our relocated catalog reveals a complex fault structure activated in response to the mainshock and provides insight into the faulting mechanics of this graduated transpressive plate boundary. We then use networkmatched filtering (NMF) to detect additional aftershocks. Using 351 aftershocks located by the AEC in 2013 as template events, we identify 1785 aftershocks through May 2013. This is a greater than fivefold increase in aftershock detection rate compared with the standard single-event network processing. Utilizing regional seismic stations and waveform modeling, we are able to characterize the faulting parameters for 12 aftershocks. Six aftershocks show focal mechanisms consistent with the mainshock faulting parameters, and six aftershocks show either thrust or strike-slip mechanisms with nodal planes rotated ∼45° from the mainshock mechanism. The six aftershocks that are inconsistent with the QCF have P axes that are perpendicular to the plate boundary, suggesting that transpression remains at this location. We show that five of these large aftershock families were activated within a day of the mainshock, whereas seven families were delayed by multiple days before activating. We show evidence for migrating patterns of seismic quiescence and elevated seismicity, relative to the predicted Omori–Utsu decay, which is related to the largest aftershock in the sequence.},

Predicting future ice-shelf destabilization under a warming ocean scenario, with the resultant reduced buttressing, faster ice flow, and sea-level rise, therefore requires an understanding of the processes that thin and weaken these shear margins. Here, we use satellite data to show that high velocity gradients result in surface troughs along the margins of fast-flowing ice streams. These troughs are advected into ice-shelf margins, where the locally thinned ice floats upward to form basal troughs. Buoyant plumes of warm ocean water beneath ice shelves can be focused into these basal troughs, localizing melting and weakening the ice-shelf margins. This implies that major ice sheet drainages are preconditioned for rapid retreat in response to ocean warming.
Fast-flowing ice shelves may form channels under their margins that promote calving and retreat under warming ocean conditions.

	abstract = {Ice rises and rumples, sites of localised ice shelf grounding, contribute to shelf-wide mechanics by generating lateral and basal shear stresses, upstream compression and downstream tension. Here, using a case study approach, we simulate Ross Ice Shelf (RIS) and tributary ice stream ﬂow, with and without the Shirase Coast Ice Rumples (SCIR), to quantify the speciﬁc contribution of these features to ﬂow dynamics. While longitudinal stretching, and thus ice velocity, increases in response 5 to pinning point removal, ﬂow resistance generated by other grounded features also increases, providing a control on the magnitude of the velocity difference. Spatial variation in two parameters inferred during model initialisation, basal friction and ice softness, further condition the system response to the SCIR. MacAyeal Ice Stream (MacIS), located directly upstream of the SCIR, is less responsive to the loss of the ice rumples than the obliquely oriented Bindschadler Ice Stream due to zones of locally higher basal drag acting on the main trunk of MacIS. In the model, the larger basal drag acting on MacIS is itself, 10 via regional changes in driving stress, a consequence of the coupled ice shelf and ice stream response to the SCIR. We also ﬁnd that inversion of present-day ﬂow and thickness for basal friction and ice softness, without feature-speciﬁc tuning, leads to the incorrect representation of ice rumple morphology, and by extension, any parameter that is affected by the initialisation procedure. Where pinning point effects are important, model tuning that respects pinning point morphology is necessary to represent the ice sheet–ice shelf system as a whole. Viewed from the perspective of change detection, we ﬁnd that changes to 15 the ice shelf geometry following removal of the SCIR are transient, as mass ﬂux reduces thickness gradients in some areas and increases them in others, while changes to the ice streams persist, even without sustained grounding line retreat.},

	abstract = {Mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has accelerated over the past two decades, coincident with rapid Arctic warming and increasing moisture transport over Greenland by atmospheric rivers (ARs). Summer ARs affecting western Greenland trigger GrIS melt events, but the physical mechanisms through which ARs induce melt are not well understood. This study elucidates the coupled surface–atmosphere processes by which ARs force GrIS melt through analysis of the surface energy balance (SEB), cloud properties, and local- to synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions during strong summer AR events affecting western Greenland. ARs are identiﬁed in MERRA-2 reanalysis (1980–2017) and classiﬁed by integrated water vapor transport (IVT) intensity. SEB, cloud, and atmospheric data from regional climate model, observational, reanalysis, and satellitebased datasets are used to analyze melt-inducing physical processes during strong, .90th percentile ‘‘AR901’’ events. Near AR ‘‘landfall,’’ AR901 days feature increased cloud cover that reduces net shortwave radiation and increases net longwave radiation. As these oppositely signed radiative anomalies partly cancel during AR901 events, increased melt energy in the ablation zone is primarily provided by turbulent heat ﬂuxes, particularly sensible heat ﬂux. These turbulent heat ﬂuxes are driven by enhanced barrier winds generated by a stronger synoptic pressure gradient combined with an enhanced local temperature contrast between cool over-ice air and the anomalously warm surrounding atmosphere. During AR901 events in northwest Greenland, anomalous melt is forced remotely through a clear-sky foehn regime produced by downslope ﬂow in eastern Greenland.},

	abstract = {Recent surveys of floating ice shelves associated with Pine Island Glacier (Antarctica) and Petermann Glacier (Greenland) indicate that there are channels incised upward into their bottoms that may serve as the conduits of meltwater outflow from the sub-ice-shelf cavity. The formation of the channels, their evolution over time, and their impact on ice-shelf flow are investigated using a fully-coupled ice-shelf/sub-ice-shelf ocean model. The model simulations suggest that channels may form spontaneously in response to meltwater plume flow initiated at the grounding line if there are relatively high melt rates and if there is transverse to ice-flow variability in ice-shelf thickness. Typical channels formed in the simulations have a width of about 1–3 km and a vertical relief of about 100–200 m. Melt rates and sea-water transport in the channels are significantly higher than on the smooth flat ice bottom between the channels. The melt channels develop through melting, deformation, and advection with ice-shelf flow. Simulations suggest that both steady state and cyclic state solutions are possible depending on conditions along the lateral ice-shelf boundaries. This peculiar dynamics of the system has strong implications on the interpretation of observations. The richness of channel morphology and evolution seen in this study suggests that further observations and theoretical analysis are imperative for understanding ice-shelf behavior in warm oceanic conditions.},

Here, moderate resolution optical satellite images are used to map and classify regions of the RIS characterized by different surface textures. Because the textures arise from ice deformation, the map is used to identify structural provinces with common deformation history. We classify four province types: regions associated with large outlet glaciers, shear zones, extension downstream of obstacles and suture zones between provinces with different upstream sources. Adjacent provinces with contrasting histories are in some locations deforming at different rates, suggesting that our province map is also an ice fabric map. Structural provinces have more complicated shapes in the part of the ice shelf fed by West Antarctic ice streams than in the part fed by outlet glaciers from the Transantarctic Mountains. The map may be used to infer past variations in stress conditions and flow events that cannot be inferred from flow traces alone.},

	abstract = {Recent thinning and loss of Antarctic ice shelves has been followed by near synchronous acceleration of ice flow that may eventually lead to sustained deflation and significant contraction in the extent of grounded and floating ice. Here, we present radiocarbon dates from foraminifera that constrain the time elapsed between a previously described paleo-ice-shelf collapse and the subsequent major grounding-line retreat in the Whales Deep Basin (WDB) of eastern Ross Sea. The dates indicate that West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) grounding-line retreat from the continental shelf edge was underway prior to 14.7 ± 0.4 cal kyr BP. A paleo-ice-shelf collapse occurred at 12.3 ± 0.2 cal kyr BP. The grounding position was maintained on the outer-continental shelf until at least 11.5 ± 0.3 cal kyr BP before experiencing a 200-km retreat. Given the age uncertainties, the major grounding-line retreat lagged ice-shelf collapse by at least two centuries and by as much as fourteen centuries. In the WDB, the centuries-long delay in the retreat of grounded ice was partly due to rapid aggradational stacking of an unusually large volume of grounding-zone-wedge sediment as ice-stream discharge accelerated following ice-shelf collapse. This new deglacial reconstruction shows that ongoing changes to ice shelves may trigger complex dynamics whose consequences are realized only after a significant lag.},

However, its estimation capability has not been demonstrated by real projects. Theoretical analysis through admittance shows that compared with gravity disturbance, gravity gradient is more sensitive to the short-wavelength seafloor topography but diminishes faster with the increase of the distance between the seafloor and airplane, indicating its superiority is recovering short-wavelength topographic features over shallow waters. We present the first numerical experiment that estimates seafloor topography from a 0.4-km resolution, real airborne gravity gradients. It is shown that airborne gravity gradiometry can recover smaller topographic features than typical airborne gravimetry, but the estimation accuracy is only \&plusmn;17 m due to the presence of subsurface density variations. The long-wavelength effect of the subsurface density variations can be removed with the aid of constraining bathymetry inside the study area, whereas the short wavelengths cannot. This study expands the applications of airborne gravity gradiometry, and helps glaciologists understand its performance in seafloor topography estimation.},

Predicting coastal SL requires the ability to monitor and simulate a multitude of physical processes affecting SL, from local effects of wind waves and river runoff to remote influences of the large-scale ocean circulation on the coast. Here we assess our current understanding of the causes of coastal SL variability on seasonal to multi-decadal timescales, including geodetic, oceanographic and atmospheric aspects of the problem, and review available observing systems informing on coastal SL. We also review the ability of current models and data assimilation systems to estimate coastal SL variations and of atmosphere-ocean global coupled models and related regional downscaling efforts to project future SL changes. We discuss (1) key observational gaps and uncertainties, and priorities for the development of an optimal and integrated coastal SL observing system, (2) strategies for advancing model capabilities in forecasting short-term processes and projecting long-term changes affecting coastal SL, and (3) possible future developments of sea level services enabling better connection of scientists and user communities and facilitating assessment and decision making for adaptation to future coastal SL change.},

	abstract = {The rate of global-mean sea-level rise since 1900 has varied over time, but the contributing factors are still poorly understood1. Previous assessments found that the summed contributions of ice-mass loss, terrestrial water storage and thermal expansion of the ocean could not be reconciled with observed changes in global-mean sea level, implying that changes in sea level or some contributions to those changes were poorly constrained2,3. Recent improvements to observational data, our understanding of the main contributing processes to sea-level change and methods for estimating the individual contributions, mean another attempt at reconciliation is warranted. Here we present a probabilistic framework to reconstruct sea level since 1900 using independent observations and their inherent uncertainties. The sum of the contributions to sea-level change from thermal expansion of the ocean, ice-mass loss and changes in terrestrial water storage is consistent with the trends and multidecadal variability in observed sea level on both global and basin scales, which we reconstruct from tide-gauge records. Ice-mass loss—predominantly from glaciers—has caused twice as much sea-level rise since 1900 as has thermal expansion. Mass loss from glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet explains the high rates of global sea-level rise during the 1940s, while a sharp increase in water impoundment by artificial reservoirs is the main cause of the lower-than-average rates during the 1970s. The acceleration in sea-level rise since the 1970s is caused by the combination of thermal expansion of the ocean and increased ice-mass loss from Greenland. Our results reconcile the magnitude of observed global-mean sea-level rise since 1900 with estimates based on the underlying processes, implying that no additional processes are required to explain the observed changes in sea level since 1900.},

	abstract = {An ice sheet model was constrained to reconstruct the evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to present to improve our understanding of its response to climate change. The study involved applying a glaciological model in series with a glacial isostatic adjustment and relative sea-level (RSL) model. The model reconstruction builds upon the work of Simpson et al. (2009) through four main extensions: (1) a larger constraint database consisting of RSL and ice extent data; model improvements to the (2) climate and (3) sea-level forcing components; (4) accounting for uncertainties in non-Greenland ice. The research was conducted primarily to address data-model misfits and to quantify inherent model uncertainties with the Earth structure and non-Greenland ice. Our new model (termed Huy3) fits the majority of observations and is characterised by a number of defining features. During the LGM, the ice sheet had an excess of 4.7 m ice-equivalent sea-level (IESL), which reached a maximum volume of 5.1 m IESL at 16.5 cal ka BP. Modelled retreat of ice from the continental shelf progressed at different rates and timings in different sectors. Southwest and Southeast Greenland began to retreat from the continental shelf by ∼16 to 14 cal ka BP, thus responding in part to the Bølling-Allerød warm event (c. 14.5 cal ka BP); subsequently ice at the southern tip of Greenland readvanced during the Younger Dryas cold event. In northern Greenland the ice retreated rapidly from the continental shelf upon the climatic recovery out of the Younger Dryas to present-day conditions. Upon entering the Holocene (11.7 cal ka BP), the ice sheet soon became land-based. During the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM; 9-5 cal ka BP), air temperatures across Greenland were marginally higher than those at present and the GrIS margin retreated inland of its present-day southwest position by 40–60 km at 4 cal ka BP which produced a deficit volume of 0.16 m IESL relative to present. In response to the HTM warmth, our optimal model reconstruction lost mass at a maximum centennial rate of c. 103.4 Gt/yr. Our results suggest that remaining data-model discrepancies are affiliated with missing physics and sub-grid processes of the glaciological model, uncertainties in the climate forcing, lateral Earth structure, and non-Greenland ice (particularly the North American component). Finally, applying the Huy3 Greenland reconstruction with our optimal Earth model we generate present-day uplift rates across Greenland due to past changes in the ocean and ice loads with explicit error bars due to uncertainties in the Earth structure. Present-day uplift rates due to past changes are spatially variable and range from 3.5 to −7 mm/a (including Earth model uncertainty).},

We identify 74 glaciers in deep fjords with AW controlling 49\% of the mass loss that retreated when warming increased undercutting by 48\%. Conversely, 27 glaciers calving on shallow ridges and 24 in cold, shallow waters retreated little, contributing 15\% of the loss, while 10 glaciers retreated substantially following the collapse of several ice shelves. The retreat mechanisms remain undiagnosed at 87 glaciers without ocean and bathymetry data, which controlled 19\% of the loss.

The atlas contains different tidal current products designed for the analysis of tidal parameters from monthly to inter-annual time scales. On shorter time scales, wind-driven inertial currents cannot be analytically separated from semidiurnal tidal constituents. Thus, we include 10–30 h band-pass filtered currents, which include all semidiurnal and diurnal tidal constituents as well as wind-driven inertial currents for the analysis of high-frequency variability of ocean dynamics. This allows for a wide range of possible uses, including local case studies of baroclinic tidal currents, assessment of long-term trends in tidal band kinetic energy and Arctic-wide validation of ocean circulation models.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic carbon emissions released into the atmosphere is driving rapid, concurrent increases in temperature and acidity across the world's oceans. Disentangling the interactive effects of warming and acidification on vulnerable life stages is important to our understanding of responses of marine species to climate change. This study evaluates the interactive effects of these stressors on the acute response of gene expression of postlarval American lobster (Homarus americanus), a species whose geographic range is warming and acidifying faster than most of the world's oceans. In the context of our experiment, we found two especially noteworthy results: First, although physiological end points have consistently been shown to be more responsive to warming in similar experimental designs, our study found gene regulation to be considerably more responsive to elevated pCO2. Furthermore, the combined effect of both stressors on gene regulation was significantly greater than either stressor alone. Using a full factorial experimental design, lobsters were raised in control and elevated pCO2 concentrations (400 ppm and 1,200 ppm) and temperatures (16°C and 19°C). A transcriptome was assembled from an identified 414,517 unique transcripts. Overall, 1,108 transcripts were differentially expressed across treatments, several of which were related to stress response and shell formation. When temperature alone was elevated (19°C), larvae downregulated genes related to cuticle development; when pCO2 alone was elevated (1,200 ppm), larvae upregulated chitinase as well as genes related to stress response and immune function. The joint effects of end-century stressors (19°C, 1,200 ppm) resulted in the upregulation of those same genes, as well as cellulase, the downregulation of calcified cuticle proteins, and a greater upregulation of genes related to immune response and function. These results indicate that changes in gene expression in larval lobster provide a mechanism to respond to stressors resulting from a rapidly changing environment.},

Our model is constrained by water depths from seismic measurements. We present a crustal density model for the region, propose a relocation for a major fault in the Sound, and reveal a dense body, 200 km long, flanking the Palmer Land side. The southern half of the Sound consists of two distinct basins 1,100 m deep, separated by a −650 m-deep ridge. This constricting ridge presents a potential barrier to ocean circulation beneath the ice shelf and may account for observed differences in temperature-salinity (T-S) profiles.},

The underlying bathymetry and cavity thickness are key inputs for modelling future ice sheet evolution. However, direct observation of sub-ice-shelf bathymetry is time-consuming, logistically risky, and in some areas simply not possible. Here we use new compilations of airborne and marine gravity, radar depth sounding, and swath bathymetry to provide new estimates of sub-ice-shelf bathymetry outboard of the rapidly changing West Antarctic Thwaites Glacier and beneath the adjacent Dotson and Crosson ice shelves. This region is of special interest, as the low-lying inland reverse slope of the Thwaites Glacier system makes it vulnerable to marine ice sheet instability, with rapid grounding line retreat observed since 1993 suggesting this process may be underway. Our results confirm a major marine channel {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\&gt;800{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;m deep extends tens of kilometres to the front of Thwaites Glacier, while the adjacent ice shelves are underlain by more complex bathymetry. Comparison of our new bathymetry with ice shelf draft reveals that ice shelves formed since 1993 comprise a distinct population where the draft conforms closely to the underlying bathymetry, unlike the older ice shelves, which show a more uniform depth of the ice base. This indicates that despite rapid basal melting in some areas, these recently floated parts of the ice shelf are not yet in dynamic equilibrium with their retreated grounding line positions and the underlying ocean system, a factor which must be included in future models of this region's evolution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we present a benchmark dataset of in situ surface melt rates and energy balance from nine sites in the eastern Antarctic Peninsula (AP) and coastal Dronning Maud Land (DML), East Antarctica, seven of which are located on AIS ice shelves. Meteorological time series from eight automatic and one staffed weather station (Neumayer), ranging in length from 15 months to almost 24 years, serve as input for an energy-balance model to obtain consistent surface melt rates and energy-balance results. We find that surface melt rates exhibit large temporal, spatial and process variability. Intermittent summer melt in coastal DML is primarily driven by absorption of shortwave radiation, while non-summer melt events in the eastern AP occur during föhn events that force a large downward directed turbulent flux of sensible heat. We use the in situ surface melt rate dataset to evaluate melt rates from the regional atmospheric climate model RACMO2 and validate a melt product from the QuikSCAT satellite.},

	abstract = {Ocean-driven basal melting of Antarctica’s floating ice shelves accounts for about half of their mass loss in steady state, where gains in ice-shelf mass are balanced by losses. Ice-shelf thickness changes driven by varying basal melt rates modulate mass loss from the grounded ice sheet and its contribution to sea level, and the changing meltwater fluxes influence climate processes in the Southern Ocean. Existing continent-wide melt-rate datasets have no temporal variability, introducing uncertainties in sea level and climate projections. Here, we combine surface height data from satellite radar altimeters with satellite-derived ice velocities and a new model of firn-layer evolution to generate a high-resolution map of time-averaged (2010–2018) basal melt rates and time series (1994–2018) of meltwater fluxes for most ice shelves. Total basal meltwater flux in 1994 (1,090 ± 150 Gt yr–1) was similar to the steady-state value (1,100 ± 60 Gt yr–1), but increased to 1,570 ± 140 Gt yr–1 in 2009, followed by a decline to 1,160 ± 150 Gt yr–1 in 2018. For the four largest ‘cold-water’ ice shelves, we partition meltwater fluxes into deep and shallow sources to reveal distinct signatures of temporal variability, providing insights into climate forcing of basal melting and the impact of this melting on the Southern Ocean.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The future surface mass balance (SMB) will influence the ice dynamics and the contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) to the sea level rise. Most of recent Antarctic SMB projections were based on the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). However, new CMIP6 results have revealed a +1.3 ∘C higher mean Antarctic near-surface temperature than in CMIP5 at the end of the 21st century, enabling estimations of future SMB in warmer climates. Here, we investigate the AIS sensitivity to different warmings with an ensemble of four simulations performed with the polar regional climate model Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) forced by two CMIP5 and two CMIP6 models over 1981–2100. Statistical extrapolation enables us to expand our results to the whole CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles. Our results highlight a contrasting effect on the future grounded ice sheet and the ice shelves. The SMB over grounded ice is projected to increase as a response to stronger snowfall, only partly offset by enhanced meltwater run-off. This leads to a cumulated sea-level-rise mitigation (i.e. an increase in surface mass) of the grounded Antarctic surface by 5.1 ± 1.9 cm sea level equivalent (SLE) in CMIP5-RCP8.5 (Relative Concentration Pathway 8.5) and 6.3 ± 2.0 cm SLE in CMIP6-ssp585 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 585). Additionally, the CMIP6 low-emission ssp126 and intermediate-emission ssp245 scenarios project a stabilized surface mass gain, resulting in a lower mitigation to sea level rise than in ssp585. Over the ice shelves, the strong run-off increase associated with higher temperature is projected to decrease the SMB (more strongly in CMIP6-ssp585 compared to CMIP5-RCP8.5). Ice shelves are however predicted to have a close-to-present-equilibrium stable SMB under CMIP6 ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios. Future uncertainties are mainly due to the sensitivity to anthropogenic forcing and the timing of the projected warming. While ice shelves should remain at a close-to-equilibrium stable SMB under the Paris Agreement, MAR projects strong SMB decrease for an Antarctic near-surface warming above +2.5 ∘C compared to 1981–2010 mean temperature, limiting the warming range before potential irreversible damages on the ice shelves. Finally, our results reveal the existence of a potential threshold (+7.5 ∘C) that leads to a lower grounded-SMB increase. This however has to be confirmed in following studies using more extreme or longer future scenarios.},

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose: This qualitative study examined the racist and sexist experiences of doctoral women of color in the academy.

Background: Doctoral women of color (e.g., Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, African Americans, Latina Americans, and Native Americans) continue to experience racism and sexism in academic spaces. While few studies have explored the experiences of doctoral students of color and doctoral women of color, with a larger emphasis on how they respond to racism, our study sought to further the knowledge and discourse surrounding the intersectionality of racism and sexism in academic contexts by examining the intersectionality of race and gender systems that impact the lived realities of doctoral women of color as women and people of color.

Methodology: This qualitative study employed multiracial feminism and Mellor’s taxonomy of coping styles as theoretical foundations to explore and understand how doctoral women of color experience and navigate racist and sexist incidents.

Contribution: The study contributes to research in various areas: (1) it expands our understanding of how doctoral women of color experience racism and sexism, (2) it deepens our perspective about the strategies and methods that they employ to negotiate and overcome these experiences, which can directly inform efforts to support and retain doctoral and other students of color, and (3) it encourages scholars to examine the experiences of doctoral women of color from an anti-deficit approach that acknowledges the social networks, skills, and knowledge that doctoral women of color rely on to disrupt and persist in inequitable contexts as they pursue academic success.

Findings: Our findings contribute a classification system that incorporates experiences of doctoral women of color with racism and sexism. Categories in this classification include covert, overt, and physical and material experiences. Our findings also present a classification system that represents navigational strategies of doctoral women of color, or the ways they respond to and overcome racist and sexist experiences. Categories in this classification include defensive, controlled, and direct strategies.

Recommendations for Practitioners: First, our findings suggest a critical need for administrators and educators to understand the experiences of women of color and recognize the impact these experiences have on their persistence and success in college. Research on doctoral women of color is limited and very little is known about the entirety of their experiences in graduate programs. This study addresses this gap by exploring how doctoral women of color persist despite the intersectionality of racist and sexist alienation and marginalization. It is important that faculty and staff engage in culturally relevant education and training in order to better understand how to support doctoral women of color as they face these situations. 

We need more educators who engage in culturally relevant and responsive practices and pedagogy that seek to include their students’ whole identities and lever-age these identities in the classroom. Additionally, more educators need to be trained in ways to recognize and address racist and sexist incidents in their class-rooms and dismantle systems of oppression rather than reinforce them. Specifically, we need to better equip educators to recognize the hard-to-distinguish sexist incidents, which, as our participants suggested, are well concealed within the fabric of our gendered and sexualized society.  

Second, this study can benefit those in program and resource development to create effective programming and strategies to engage these acts of resilience that enable women of color to succeed in graduate school. Rather than approaching the support and development of doctoral women of color from a deficit perspective of assisting them through challenges, it is more important to fully-engage with these students to recognize what coping strategies they have used that can better inform successful retention programs. Furthermore, mentorship from faculty was highlighted as an important means for participants to address and cope with their negative experiences. Thus, more mentoring relationships between faculty and the student and across student peer groups should be intentionally engaged. This is a system of support also noted in extant literature. As part of the doctoral socialization process, mentoring has many benefits for doctoral students. Specifically, for doctoral women of color, mentoring relationships can be a critical tool for supporting them in managing negative experiences, especially considering that it can minimize feelings of loneliness and isolation.


Recommendation for Researchers: Our research contributes to the literature with emphasis on the ways in which doctoral women of color respond to and cope with racism and sexism. Women in this study recount racist and sexist experiences and describe their decision-making processes about how and whether to respond. There were specific reasons that shaped their responses and coping strategies, which highlight awareness and confidence in their individual abilities.

The study’s findings also contribute to and expand Mellor’s taxonomy, specifically the incorporation of sexism as a system inherently interlocked with racism. Current literature on doctoral women of color mainly highlights their experience with racism; this gap reinforces our contribution to the literature, specifically, in illuminating predetermined societal roles and expectations for doctoral women of color in academia.

Most importantly, our research highlights the assets and agency that doctoral women of color mobilize in the face of racism and sexism. These assets include long-term goals and aspirations, awareness of interlocking systems of oppression shaping their experience in academic environments, commitment to empowering their communities through education, and the support they find within their personal and academic networks. These assets and agency serve as foundation to challenge longstanding deficit perspectives on doctoral women of color in academic spaces and for faculty and program administrators to consider when developing support services.


Impact on Society: Our findings encourage faculty, program administrators, and researchers to pay attention to racist and sexist issues as intersecting oppressions rather than distinct manifestations of prejudice to be confronted separately. Our findings also highlight the assets doctoral women of color rely on to overcome oppression and marginalization including their long-term goals and aspirations, awareness of interlocking systems of oppression shaping their experience in academic, commitment to empowering their communities through education, and the support they find within their personal and academic networks. Our hope is that this work encourages systems of higher education to create tangible ways to support doctoral women of color as they grapple with the multiple systems of domination that threaten their success in education, which is intertwined with success in other aspects of society.

Future Research: Lastly, future research may explore how the matrix of domination mediates responses of doctoral women of color to racism and sexism. This philosophical inclination is linked to our decision to use Mellor’s taxonomy of coping styles as an introductory framework for our work in understanding navigational strategies. To that end, we argue that the taxonomy as it stands characterizes participants’ responses based on their immediate approach to incidents. This framing fails to include the timing someone might need to process and decide to how to respond. Mellor’s taxonomy positions participants who do not choose to respond immediately as compliant and acquiescent to racialized spaces and events. By doing so, we run the risk of oversimplifying and essentializing the complex processes individuals faced with racism and sexism undertake. 

At the same time, future research can examine the connection between responses or coping styles and ways that participants are internally transformed in their abilities and desires to address future incidents. There is an inordinate amount of focus on how individuals interact with oppressive incidents and yet very little is known about the ways that these interactions shape future responses. Additionally, the ways that doctoral women of color navigate situations outside the academy is not explored. For example, some of our participants shared how racist and sexist encounters empowered them or inspired them to address other incidents and to interact with family and community members.},

	abstract = {Global climate change drives sea-level rise, increasing the frequency of coastal flooding. In most coastal regions, the amount of sea-level rise occurring over years to decades is significantly smaller than normal ocean-level fluctuations caused by tides, waves, and storm surge. However, even gradual sea-level rise can rapidly increase the frequency and severity of coastal flooding. So far, global-scale estimates of increased coastal flooding due to sea-level rise have not considered elevated water levels due to waves, and thus underestimate the potential impact. Here we use extreme value theory to combine sea-level projections with wave, tide, and storm surge models to estimate increases in coastal flooding on a continuous global scale. We find that regions with limited water-level variability, i.e., short-tailed flood-level distributions, located mainly in the Tropics, will experience the largest increases in flooding frequency. The 10 to 20 cm of sea-level rise expected no later than 2050 will more than double the frequency of extreme water-level events in the Tropics, impairing the developing economies of equatorial coastal cities and the habitability of low-lying Pacific island nations.},

Distributed surface mass balance models, which translate the meteorological conditions on glaciers into local melting rates, help to attribute and detect glacier mass and volume responses to changes in the climate drivers. A well-calibrated model is a suitable test bed for sensitivity, detection, and attribution analyses for many scientific applications and often serves as a tool for quantifying the inherent uncertainties. Here, we present the open-source COupled Snowpack and Ice surface energy and mass balance model in PYthon (COSIPY), which provides a flexible and user-friendly framework for modeling distributed snow and glacier mass changes. The model has a modular structure so that the exchange of routines or parameterizations of physical processes is possible with little effort for the user. The framework consists of a computational kernel, which forms the runtime environment and takes care of the initialization, the input–output routines, and the parallelization, as well as the grid and data structures. This structure offers maximum flexibility without having to worry about the internal numerical flow. The adaptive subsurface scheme allows an efficient and fast calculation of the otherwise computationally demanding fundamental equations. The surface energy balance scheme uses established standard parameterizations for radiation as well as for the energy exchange between atmosphere and surface. The schemes are coupled by solving both surface energy balance and subsurface fluxes iteratively such that consistent surface skin temperature is returned at the interface. COSIPY uses a one-dimensional approach limited to the vertical fluxes of energy and matter but neglects any lateral processes. Accordingly, the model can be easily set up in parallel computational environments for calculating both energy balance and climatic surface mass balance of glacier surfaces based on flexible horizontal grids and with varying temporal resolution. The model is made available on a freely accessible site and can be used for non-profit purposes. Scientists are encouraged to actively participate in the extension and improvement of the model code.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {West Antarctica (WA), especially the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS), has experienced more frequent surface melting during austral summer recently. The future is likely to see enhanced surface melting that will jeopardize the stability of ice shelves and cause ice loss. We investigate four major melt cases over the RIS via Polar WRF simulations (4km resolution) driven by ERA5 reanalysis data and MODIS observed albedo. Direct warm air advection, recurring foehn effect, and cloud/upper warm air introduced radiative warming are the three major regional causes of surface melting over WA. In this paper, Part I, the first two factors are identified and quantified. The second paper, Part II, discusses the impact of clouds and summarizes all three factors from a surface energy balance perspective. With a high-pressure ridge located westward towards the Sulzberger Ice Shelf (77 °S, 148 °W) and a low-pressure center located between 165 °W – 180 °W, warm marine air from the Ross Sea is advected towards the coastal RIS and leads to surface melting. When the high-pressure ridge is located farther east towards Marie Byrd Land (120 °W – 150 °W), the foehn effect can cause a 2 – 4 °C increase in surface temperature on the leeside of the mountains. For three of four melt cases, more than 40\% of the melting period experiences foehn warming. Isentropic drawdown is usually the dominant foehn mechanism and contributes up to a 14 °C temperature increase, especially when strong low-level blocking occurs on the upwind side. The thermodynamic mechanism can be important depending on the strength of moisture uptake and condensation on the windward side. Meanwhile, sensible heat flux contributes less to foehn warming, but still plays an important role in the melting. The prediction of future stability of the RIS should include foehn warming as a major driver.},

The near-surface temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity are compared with datasets of in situ observations, together with an assessment of the simulated surface mass balance (approximated by precipitation minus evaporation). No reanalysis clearly stands out as the best performing for all areas, seasons, and variables, and each of the reanalyses displays different biases. CFSR strongly overestimates the relative humidity during all seasons whereas ERA-5 and MERRA-2 (and, to a lesser extent, ERA-Interim) strongly underestimate relative humidity during winter. ERA-5 captures the seasonal cycle of near-surface temperature best and shows the smallest bias relative to the observations. The other reanalyses show a general temperature underestimation during the winter months in the Antarctic interior and overestimation in the coastal areas. All reanalyses underestimate the mean near-surface winds in the interior (except MERRA-2) and along the coast during the entire year. The winds at the Antarctic Peninsula are overestimated by all reanalyses except MERRA-2. All models are able to capture snowfall patterns related to atmospheric rivers, with varying accuracy. Accumulation is best represented by ERA-5, although it underestimates observed surface mass balance and there is some variability in the accumulation over the different elevation classes, for all reanalyses.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

A dataset of more than 250 measured depth-density profiles from both ice sheets provides the basis of the calibration of the dry-snow densification scheme. The resulting scheme results in a reduction in the rate of densification, relative to a commonly used semi-empirical model, through a decreased dependence on the accumulation rate, a proxy for 15 overburden stress. The modelled firn column runoff, when combined with atmospheric variables from MERRA-2, generates realistic mean integrated surface mass balance values for the Greenland (+361 Gt yr-1) and Antarctic (+2623 Gt yr-1) ice sheets when compared to published model-ensemble means. We find that seasonal volume changes associated with firn air content are approximately 3 times larger than those associated with surface mass balance; however, when averaged over multiple years, ice and air-volume fluctuations within the firn column are of comparable magnitudes. Between 1996 and 2019, the 20 Greenland Ice Sheet lost more than 5\% of its firn air content indicating a reduction in the total meltwater retention capability. Nearly all ({\textgreater}98\%) of the meltwater produced over the Antarctic Ice Sheet is retained within the firn column through infiltration and refreezing.},

Therefore, biases and errors in presently used density models confound assessments of ice sheet mass balance and by extension ice sheet contribution to sea level rise. Despite this importance, most contemporary firn densification models rely on simplified semi-empirical methods, which are partially reflected by significant modeled density errors when compared to observations. In this study, we present a new drifting-snow compaction scheme that we have implemented into SNOWPACK, a physics-based land surface snow model. We show that our new scheme improves existing versions of SNOWPACK by increasing simulated near-surface (defined as the top 10 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}m{\textless}/span{\textgreater}) density to be more in line with observations (near-surface bias reduction from {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}44.9 to {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}5.4 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}kg m$^{\textrm{−3}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}).

In this study, using the dropsonde observations, we evaluate the performance of the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA2) in representing the Antarctic boundary layer thermodynamic structure. Results show that MERRA2 has a good overall representation of the Antarctic surface stability and correctly predicts 82\% of the SBIs. However, an underprediction of less stable boundary layer occurrence, especially over the elevated East Antarctic plateau, is favored during conditions of increased lower tropospheric stability associated with model dynamics, indicating difficulty in parameterizing turbulence in very stable boundary layers. In addition, a lower tropospheric cool bias (first model level and above) is observed in the MERRA2 reanalysis, especially over West Antarctica, which amplifies in the boundary layer during mixed conditions. The near-surface cold bias is most pronounced when the model fails to predict mixed layers over West Antarctica and is expected to negatively impact the representation of surface energy budget and melt processes.},

The near-surface temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity are compared with datasets of in situ observations, together with an assessment of the simulated surface mass balance (approximated by precipitation minus evaporation). No reanalysis clearly stands out as the best performing for all areas, seasons, and variables, and each of the reanalyses displays different biases. CFSR strongly overestimates the relative humidity during all seasons whereas ERA-5 and MERRA-2 (and, to a lesser extent, ERA-Interim) strongly underestimate relative humidity during winter. ERA-5 captures the seasonal cycle of near-surface temperature best and shows the smallest bias relative to the observations. The other reanalyses show a general temperature underestimation during the winter months in the Antarctic interior and overestimation in the coastal areas. All reanalyses underestimate the mean near-surface winds in the interior (except MERRA-2) and along the coast during the entire year. The winds at the Antarctic Peninsula are overestimated by all reanalyses except MERRA-2. All models are able to capture snowfall patterns related to atmospheric rivers, with varying accuracy. Accumulation is best represented by ERA-5, although it underestimates observed surface mass balance and there is some variability in the accumulation over the different elevation classes, for all reanalyses.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The catastrophic collapses of Larsen A and B ice shelves on the eastern Antarctic Peninsula have caused their tributary glaciers to accelerate, contributing to sea-level rise and freshening the Antarctic Bottom Water formed nearby. The surface of Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS), the largest ice shelf on the peninsula, is lowering. This could be caused by unbalanced ocean melting (ice loss) or enhanced ﬁrn melting and compaction (englacial air loss). Using a novel method to analyse eight radar surveys, this study derives separate estimates of ice and air thickness changes during a 15-year period. The uncertainties are considerable, but the primary estimate is that the surveyed lowering (0.066 ± 0.017 m yr−1) is caused by both ice loss (0.28 ± 0.18 m yr−1) and ﬁrn-air loss (0.037 ± 0.026 m yr−1). The ice loss is much larger than the air loss, but both contribute approximately equally to the lowering because the ice is ﬂoating. The ice loss could be explained by high basal melting and/or ice divergence, and the air loss by low surface accumulation or high surface melting and/or compaction. The primary estimate therefore requires that at least two forcings caused the surveyed lowering. Mechanisms are discussed by which LCIS stability could be compromised in the future. The most rapid pathways to collapse are offered by the ungrounding of LCIS from Bawden Ice Rise or ice-front retreat past a “compressive arch” in strain rates. Recent evidence suggests that either mechanism could pose an imminent risk.},

The model differs from established models by the high degree of flexibility in switching between different electromagnetic theories, representations of snow microstructure, and other modules involved in various calculation steps. SMRT v1.0 includes the dense media radiative transfer theory (DMRT), the improved Born approximation (IBA), and independent Rayleigh scatterers to compute the intrinsic electromagnetic properties of a snow layer. In the case of IBA, five different formulations of the autocorrelation function to describe the snow microstructure characteristics are available, including the sticky hard sphere model, for which close equivalence between the IBA and DMRT theories has been shown here. Validation is demonstrated against established theories and models. SMRT was used to identify that several former studies conducting simulations with in situ measured snow properties are now comparable and moreover appear to be quantitatively nearly equivalent. This study also proves that a third parameter is needed in addition to density and specific surface area to characterize the microstructure. The paper provides a comprehensive description of the mathematical basis of SMRT and its numerical implementation in Python. Modularity supports model extensions foreseen in future versions comprising other media (e.g., sea ice, frozen lakes), different scattering theories, rough surface models, or new microstructure models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The model differs from established models by the high degree of flexibility in switching between different electromagnetic theories, representations of snow microstructure, and other modules involved in various calculation steps. SMRT v1.0 includes the dense media radiative transfer theory (DMRT), the improved Born approximation (IBA), and independent Rayleigh scatterers to compute the intrinsic electromagnetic properties of a snow layer. In the case of IBA, five different formulations of the autocorrelation function to describe the snow microstructure characteristics are available, including the sticky hard sphere model, for which close equivalence between the IBA and DMRT theories has been shown here. Validation is demonstrated against established theories and models. SMRT was used to identify that several former studies conducting simulations with in situ measured snow properties are now comparable and moreover appear to be quantitatively nearly equivalent. This study also proves that a third parameter is needed in addition to density and specific surface area to characterize the microstructure. The paper provides a comprehensive description of the mathematical basis of SMRT and its numerical implementation in Python. Modularity supports model extensions foreseen in future versions comprising other media (e.g., sea ice, frozen lakes), different scattering theories, rough surface models, or new microstructure models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Since drifting snow mostly results from erosion of surface particles, a comprehensive evaluation of this process in climate models requires a concurrent assessment of simulated drifting-snow transport and the surface mass balance (SMB). In this paper a new version of the drifting-snow scheme currently embedded in the regional climate model MAR (v3.11) is extensively described. Several important modifications relative to previous version have been implemented and include notably a parameterization for drifting-snow compaction of the uppermost snowpack layer, differentiated snow density at deposition between precipitation and drifting snow, and a rewrite of the threshold friction velocity above which snow erosion initiates. Model results at high resolution (10 km) over Adélie Land, East Antarctica, for the period 2004–2018 are presented and evaluated against available near-surface meteorological observations at half-hourly resolution and annual SMB estimates. The evaluation demonstrates that MAR resolves the local drifting-snow frequency and transport up to the scale of the drifting-snow event and captures the resulting observed climate and SMB variability, suggesting that this model version can be used for continent-wide applications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is based on six-flux theory to describe radiative transfer in snow including absorption, multiple volume scattering, radiation trapping due to internal reflection and a combination of coherent and incoherent superposition of reflections between horizontal layer interfaces. Here we introduce MEMLS3\&a, an extension of MEMLS, which includes a backscatter model for active microwave remote sensing of snow. The reflectivity is decomposed into diffuse and specular components. Slight undulations of the snow surface are taken into account. The treatment of like- and cross-polarization is accomplished by an empirical splitting parameter \textit{q}. MEMLS3\&a (as well as MEMLS) is set up in a way that snow input parameters can be derived by objective measurement methods which avoid fitting procedures of the scattering efficiency of snow, required by several other models. For the validation of the model we have used a combination of active and passive measurements from the NoSREx (Nordic Snow Radar Experiment) campaign in Sodankylä, Finland. We find a reasonable agreement between the measurements and simulations, subject to uncertainties in hitherto unmeasured input parameters of the backscatter model.

Here, we use these basal accumulation rates and the InSAR velocity data to estimate the distribution and thickness of marine ice beneath the Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf. These estimates are compared with a marine-ice thickness map derived from radio-echo sounding (RES) data and airborne radar altimetry. In general, we find close agreement between these estimates. In the few locations where there are significant differences, the discrepancies are largely attributable to artifacts in the radar-altimeter thickness map. With improvements such as a much smaller footprint, the next generation of altimeters should overcome many of these limitations, leading to improved marine-ice accumulation estimates. Overall, the good agreement with the RES data validates the InSAR-based estimates over much of the Ronne Ice Shelf.},

We have also produced a map of the thickness of marine ice bodies beneath the ice shelf by using borehole density data to calibrate an ice thickness to surface-elevation relation, and then comparing maps of ice surface elevation and meteoric ice thickness to infer marine ice thickness. Due to denser data coverage and the improved density-depth relation, the resulting map is a significant improvement on its predecessors and allows insight into the glaciological context of the ice shelf, in particular, into the location of the grounding lines on the southern Ronne Ice Shelf. Here the data were supplemented with barometric determination of surface elevation, which were used to locate the grounding line position. The final delineation of the grounding line position was confirmed by reference to satellite imagery, and revealed that earlier estimates were substantially in error, especially in the area of Foundation Ice Stream and Möllereisstrom.},

We present new ice-penetrating radar data from two systems operating at center frequencies of 7 and 750 MHz that confirm the ice rise is composed of a former ice shelf buried by subsequent accumulation. Stacks of englacial diffraction hyperbolas are present almost everywhere across the central ice rise and extend up to {\textasciitilde}350 m above the bed. In many cases, bed reflections beneath the diffraction hyperbolas are obscured for distances up to 1 km. Waveform modeling indicates that the diffraction hyperbolas are likely caused by marine ice deposits in former basal crevasses and rifts. The in-filling of rifts and basal crevasses may have strengthened the connection between the ice rise and the surrounding ice shelf, which could have influenced local and regional ice dynamics. Three internal reflection horizons mark the upper limit of disturbed ice and diffraction hyperbolas in different sections of the ice rise, indicating at least three stages of flow stabilization across the ice rise. A surface lineation visible in MODIS imagery corresponds spatially to deepening and strong deformation of these layers, consistent with the characteristics of former grounding lines observed elsewhere in Antarctica.},

	abstract = {Recent modeling studies of ocean circulation in the southern Weddell Sea, Antarctica, project an increase over this century of ocean heat into the cavity beneath Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS). This increase in ocean heat would lead to more basal melting and a modiﬁcation of the FRIS ice draft. The corresponding change in cavity shape will affect advective pathways and the spatial distribution of tidal currents, which play important roles in basal melting under FRIS. These feedbacks between heat ﬂux, basal melting, and tides will affect the evolution of FRIS under the inﬂuence of a changing climate. We explore these feedbacks with a three-dimensional ocean model of the southern Weddell Sea that is forced by thermodynamic exchange beneath the ice shelf and tides along the open boundaries. Our results show regionally dependent feedbacks that, in some areas, substantially modify the melt rates near the grounding lines of buttressed ice streams that ﬂow into FRIS. These feedbacks are introduced by variations in meltwater production as well as the circulation of this meltwater within the FRIS cavity; they are inﬂuenced locally by sensitivity of tidal currents to water column thickness (wct) and non-locally by changes in circulation pathways that transport an integrated history of mixing and meltwater entrainment along ﬂow paths. Our results highlight the importance of including explicit tidal forcing in models of future mass loss from FRIS and from the adjacent grounded ice sheet as individual ice-stream grounding zones experience different responses to warming of the ocean inﬂow.},

We revisited the region in austral summer 2018 with detailed hydrographic and noble gas surveys along FRIS. The FRIS front was characterized by High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) in Ronne Depression, Ice Shelf Water (ISW) on its eastern flank, and an inflow of modified Warm Deep Water (mWDW) entering through Central Trough. Filchner Trough was dominated by Ronne HSSW-sourced ISW, likely forced by a recently intensified circulation beneath FRIS due to enhanced sea ice production in the Ronne polynya since 2015. Glacial meltwater fractions and tracer-based water mass dating indicate two separate ISW outflow cores, one hugging the Berkner slope after a two-year travel time, and the other located in the central Filchner Trough following a ∼six year-long transit through the FRIS cavity. Historical measurements indicate the presence of two distinct modes, in which water masses in Filchner Trough were dominated by either Ronne HSSW-derived ISW (Ronne-mode) or more locally derived Berkner-HSSW (Berkner-mode). While the dominance of these modes has alternated on interannual time scales, ocean densities in Filchner Trough have remained remarkably stable since the first surveys in 1980. Indeed, geostrophic velocities indicated outflowing ISW-cores along the trough's western flank and onto Berkner Bank, which suggests that Ronne-ISW preconditions Berkner-HSSW production. The negligible density difference between Berkner- and Ronne-mode waters indicates that each contributes cold dense shelf waters to protect FRIS against inflowing mWDW.},

	abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Operation IceBridge (OIB) was a 13-year (2009–2021) airborne mission to survey land and sea ice across the Arctic, Antarctic, and Alaska. Here, we review OIB’s goals, instruments, campaigns, key scientific results, and implications for future investigations of the cryosphere. OIB’s primary goal was to use airborne laser altimetry to bridge the gap in fine-resolution elevation measurements of ice from space between the conclusion of NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat; 2003–2009) and its follow-on, ICESat-2 (launched 2018). Additional scientific requirements were intended to contextualize observed elevation changes using a multisensor suite of radar sounders, gravimeters, magnetometers, and cameras. Using 15 different aircraft, OIB conducted 968 science flights, of which 42\% were repeat surveys of land ice, 42\% were surveys of previously unmapped terrain across the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, Arctic ice caps, and Alaskan glaciers, and 16\% were surveys of sea ice. The combination of an expansive instrument suite and breadth of surveys enabled numerous fundamental advances in our understanding of the Earth’s cryosphere. For land ice, OIB dramatically improved knowledge of interannual outlet-glacier variability, ice-sheet, and outlet-glacier thicknesses, snowfall rates on ice sheets, fjord and sub-ice-shelf bathymetry, and ice-sheet hydrology. Unanticipated discoveries included a reliable method for constraining the thickness within difficult-to-sound incised troughs beneath ice sheets, the extent of the firn aquifer within the Greenland Ice Sheet, the vulnerability of many Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers to ocean-driven melting at their grounding zones, and the dominance of surface-melt-driven mass loss of Alaskan glaciers. For sea ice, OIB significantly advanced our understanding of spatiotemporal variability in sea ice freeboard and its snow cover, especially through combined analysis of fine-resolution altimetry, visible imagery, and snow radar measurements of the overlying snow thickness. Such analyses led to the unanticipated discovery of an interdecadal decrease in snow thickness on Arctic sea ice and numerous opportunities to validate sea ice freeboards from satellite radar altimetry. While many of its data sets have yet to be fully explored, OIB’s scientific legacy has already demonstrated the value of sustained investment in reliable airborne platforms, airborne instrument development, interagency and international collaboration, and open and rapid data access to advance our understanding of Earth’s remote polar regions and their role in the Earth system.},

	abstract = {The changing supply of warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) to the West Antarctic continental shelf is responsible for the basal melting and thinning of the West Antarctic ice shelves that has occurred in recent decades. Here we assess the variability in CDW supply, and its drivers, from a multiyear mooring deployed in, and a regional ocean model spanning, the Getz-Dotson Trough, Amundsen Sea. Between 2010 to 2015, the CDW within the trough underwent a pronounced cooling and freshening, associated with changes in thermohaline properties on isopycnals. Variability in the rate of CDW inflow is controlled by local wind forcing of a shelf break undercurrent, which determines the hydrographic properties of inflowing CDW via tilting of density surfaces above the continental slope. Local wind is coupled to the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) low-pressure system, which is modulated by large-scale climatic modes via atmospheric teleconnections. For the period analyzed, a deeper ASL was associated with westward wind anomaly at the shelf break. Changes in the sea surface slope decelerated the shelf break undercurrent, resulting in less heat accessing the continental shelf and, consequently, a cooling of the Getz-Dotson Trough. Therefore, the present work suggests that the fate of the West Antarctic ice shelves is closely tied to the future evolution of the ASL.},

The snow model is verified for the French Alps by comparing its simulations to observations performed at the Col de Porte in the Chartreuse Massif. The snow erosion threshold depends on snow-pack properties such as density, dendricity, sphericity and particle size. The atmospheric turbulence scheme is modified in order to take into account stabilization effects due to airborne blown snow particles. In particular, vertically integrated stability functions for the stable boundary layer are completed by including the threshold friction velocity for snow erosion. The snow-drift model is calibrated by simulating the conditions observed during the Byrd snow project, held in West Antarctica in 1962. Finally, sensitivity experiments to the snow-surface properties show the importance of their accurate representation when modelling the contribution of deflation to the Antarctic surface mass balance.},

Closure of the budget is reflected by the analysis increments term, which indicates an energy surplus of 11 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ over the North Polar cap (70°–90°N) and 22 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ over the South Polar cap (70°–90°S). Total atmospheric energy convergence from MERRA compares favorably with previous studies for northern high latitudes but exceeds the available previous estimate for the South Polar cap by 46\%. Discrepancies with the Southern Hemisphere energy transport are largest in autumn and may be related to differences in topography with earlier reanalyses. For the Arctic, differences between MERRA and other sources in top of atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiative fluxes are largest in May. These differences are concurrent with the largest discrepancies between MERRA parameterized and observed surface albedo. For May, in situ observations of the upwelling shortwave flux in the Arctic are 80 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ larger than MERRA, while the MERRA downwelling longwave flux is underestimated by 12 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ throughout the year. Over grounded ice sheets, the annual mean net surface energy flux in MERRA is erroneously nonzero. Contemporary reanalyses from the Climate Forecast Center (CFSR) and the Interim Re-Analyses of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA-I) are found to have better surface parameterizations; however, these reanalyses also disagree with observed surface and TOA energy fluxes. Discrepancies among available reanalyses underscore the challenge of reproducing credible estimates of the atmospheric energy budget in polar regions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Both ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica are discharging ice into the ocean. In many regions along the coast of the ice sheets, the icebergs calf into a bay. If the addition of icebergs through calving is faster than their transport out of the embayment, the icebergs will be frozen into a mélange with surrounding sea ice in winter. In this case, the buttressing effect of the ice mélange can be considerably stronger than any buttressing by mere sea ice would be. This in turn stabilizes the glacier 5 terminus and leads to a reduction in calving rates. Here we propose a simple but robust buttressing model of ice mélange which can be used in numerical and analytical modeling.},

The simultaneous operation of these two satellite altimeters enables unique comparison studies of sea ice altimetry, utilizing the different frequencies and profiling strategies of the two instruments. Here, we use freeboard data from ICESat-2 to assess Antarctic snow freeboard retrievals from CryoSat-2. We first discuss updates made to a previously published CryoSat-2 retrieval process and show how this Version 2 algorithm improves upon the original method by comparing the new retrievals to ICESat-2 in specific along-track profiles as well as on the basin-scale. In two near-coincident along-track profiles, we find mean snow freeboard differences (standard deviations of differences) of 0.3 (9.3) and 7.6 cm (9.6 cm) with 25 km binned correlation coefficients of 0.77 and 0.89. Monthly mean freeboard differences range between −2.9 (10.8) and 6.6 cm (16.8 cm) basin wide, with the largest differences typically occurring in Austral fall months that is hypothesized to be related to new ice growth and the use of static snow backscatter coefficients in the retrieval. Monthly mean correlation coefficients range between 0.57 and 0.80. While coincident data show good agreement between the two sensors, they highlight issues related to geometric and frequency sampling differences that can impact the freeboard distributions.},

	abstract = {Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is the response of the solid Earth to past ice loading, primarily, since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20 K yr BP. Modelling GIA is challenging because of large uncertainties in ice loading history and also the viscosity of the upper and lower mantle. GPS data contain the signature of GIA in their uplift rates but these also contain other sources of vertical land motion (VLM) such as tectonics, human and natural inﬂuences on water storage that can mask the underlying GIA signal. In this study, we use about 4000 GPS vertical velocities as observational estimates of global GIA uplift rates, after correcting for major elastic deformation effects. A novel fully automatic strategy is developed to postprocess the GPS time-series and to correct for non-GIA artefacts. Before estimating vertical velocities and uncertainties, we detect outliers and jumps and correct for atmospheric mass loading displacements. We correct the resulting velocities for the elastic response of the solid Earth to global changes in ice sheets, glaciers and ocean loading, as well as for changes in the Earth’s rotational pole relative to the 20th century average. We then apply a spatial median ﬁlter to remove sites where local effects are dominant to leave approximately 4000 GPS sites. The resulting novel global GPS data set shows a clean GIA signal at all post-processed stations and is therefore suitable to investigate the behavior of global GIA forward models. The results are transformed from a frame with its origin in the centre of mass of the total Earth’s system (CM) into a frame with its origin in the centre of mass of the solid Earth (CE) before comparison with 13 global GIA forward model solutions, with best ﬁts with Pur-6VM5 and ICE-6G predictions. The largest discrepancies for all models were identiﬁed for Antarctica and Greenland, which may be due to either uncertain mantle rheology, ice loading history/magnitude and/or GPS errors.},

Here we present hydrographic and microscale turbulence measurements from six fjords in Northwestern (69°N–75°N) Greenland. Water mass distributions showed the presence of warm bottom water of Atlantic origin in all fjord transects and a significant modification of upper water masses in fjords with tidewater outlet glaciers. Spatial and temporal distribution of turbulence in the fjords showed, in general, low rates of turbulent kinetic energy, ε (∼10−9 W kg−1), and strong stratification implies that vertical exchange in the upper ∼200 m was relatively weak. However, measurements within 2 km of the terminus of a tidewater outlet glacier showed values of ε and inferred turbulent diffusion coefficients {\textgreater}10−4 m2 s−1 that were about two orders of magnitude larger than elsewhere in the deep fjords. This elevated mixing corresponded to comparatively large heat and salt fluxes. These observations suggest that vertical mixing near tidewater outlet glaciers results in localized mixing hot spots, likely due to subglacial discharge and near-glacial current shear, that contribute significantly to vertical exchange in the deep fjords.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment
(CORDEX) is a scientific effort of the World Climate Research Program (WRCP)
for the coordination of regional climate initiatives. In order to accept an
experiment, CORDEX provides experiment guidelines, specifications of regional
domains, and data access and archiving. CORDEX experiments are important to study
climate at the regional scale, and at the same time, they also have a very
prominent role in providing regional climate data of high quality. Data
requirements are intended to cover all the possible needs of stakeholders
and scientists working on climate change mitigation and adaptation policies
in various scientific communities. The required data and diagnostics are
grouped into different levels of frequency and priority, and some of them even
have to be provided as statistics (minimum, maximum, mean) over different
time periods. Most commonly, scientists need to post-process the raw output
of regional climate models, since the latter was not originally designed to
meet the specific CORDEX data requirements. This post-processing procedure
includes the computation of diagnostics, statistics, and final homogenization
of the data, which is often computationally costly and time-consuming.
Therefore, the development of specialized software and/or code is required.
The current paper presents the development of a specialized module (version 1.3) for the Weather Research
and Forecasting (WRF) model capable of
outputting the required CORDEX variables. Additional diagnostic variables not
required by CORDEX, but of potential interest to the regional climate
modeling community, are also included in the module. “Generic” definitions of
variables are adopted in order to overcome the model and/or physics
parameterization dependence of certain diagnostics and variables, thus
facilitating a robust comparison among simulations. The module is
computationally optimized, and the output is divided into different priority
levels following CORDEX specifications (Core, Tier 1, and additional) by
selecting pre-compilation flags. This implementation of the module does not
add a significant extra cost when running the model; for example, the addition
of the Core variables slows the model time step by less than a 5 \%. The use
of the module reduces the requirements of disk storage by about a 50 \%. The
module performs neither additional statistics over different periods of time
nor homogenization of the output data.},

Ice flow and grounding line retreat are variably governed by the coupling between the ice and underlying terrain. We ask to what degree catchment-scale bed characteristics determine ice flow and retreat, drawing on paleo-ice sheet landform imprints from 99 sites on continental shelves worldwide. We find that topographic setting has broadly steered ice flow and that the bed slope favors particular styles of retreat. However, we find exceptions to accepted “rules” of behavior: Regional topographic highs are not always an impediment to fast ice flow, retreat may proceed in a controlled, steady manner on reverse slopes and, unexpectedly, the occurrence of ice streaming is not favored on a particular geological substrate. Furthermore, once grounding line retreat is under way, readvance is rarely observed regardless of regional bed characteristics.
Geological records of former ice sheets show that behavior cannot be predicted solely from catchment-scale topography and geology.

We estimate ice loss corresponding to a sea level rise of 8.1 ± 1.1 millimetres from these three glaciers. Projections of mass loss for these glaciers, using the worst-case scenario, Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5, suggest a sea level contribution of 9.1–14.9 mm by 2100. RCP8.5 implies an additional global temperature increase of 3.7 °C by 2100, approximately four times larger than that which has taken place since 1880. We infer that projections forced by RCP8.5 underestimate glacier mass loss which could exceed this worst-case scenario.},

	abstract = {Surface meltwater reaching the base of the Greenland Ice Sheet transits through drainage networks, modulating the flow of the ice sheet. Dye and gas-tracing studies conducted in the western margin sector of the ice sheet have directly observed drainage efficiency to evolve seasonally along the drainage pathway. However, the local evolution of drainage systems further inland, where ice thicknesses exceed 1000 m, remains largely unknown. Here, we infer drainage system transmissivity based on surface uplift relaxation following rapid lake drainage events. Combining field observations of five lake drainage events with a mathematical model and laboratory experiments, we show that the surface uplift decreases exponentially with time, as the water in the blister formed beneath the drained lake permeates through the subglacial drainage system. This deflation obeys a universal relaxation law with a timescale that reveals hydraulic transmissivity and indicates a two-order-of-magnitude increase in subglacial transmissivity (from 0.8 ± 0.3 \$\$\{{\textbackslash}rm\{m\}\}\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{m\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$\$to 215 ± 90.2 \$\$\{{\textbackslash}rm\{m\}\}\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{m\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$\$) as the melt season progresses, suggesting significant changes in basal hydrology beneath the lakes driven by seasonal meltwater input.},

	abstract = {The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) remains the largest uncertainty in projections of future sea level rise. A likely climate-driven vulnerability of the AIS is thinning of floating ice shelves resulting from surface-melt-driven hydrofracture or incursion of relatively warm water into subshelf ocean cavities. The resulting melting, weakening, and potential ice shelf collapse reduces shelf buttressing effects. Upstream ice flow accelerates, causing thinning, grounding-line retreat, and potential ice sheet collapse. While high-resolution projections have been performed for localized Antarctic regions, full-continent simulations have typically been limited to low-resolution models. Here we quantify the vulnerability of the entire present-day AIS to regional ice shelf collapse on millennial timescales treating relevant ice flow dynamics at the necessary ∼1-km resolution. Collapse of any of the ice shelves dynamically connected to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is sufficient to trigger ice sheet collapse in marine-grounded portions of the WAIS. Vulnerability elsewhere appears limited to localized responses.},

	abstract = {Mass loss from the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has increased in recent decades, suggestive of sustained ocean forcing or an ongoing, possibly unstable, response to a past climate anomaly. Lengthening satellite records appear to be incompatible with either process, however, revealing both periodic hiatuses in acceleration and intermittent episodes of thinning. Here we use ocean temperature, salinity, dissolved-oxygen and current measurements taken from 2000 to 2016 near the Dotson Ice Shelf to determine temporal changes in net basal melting. A decadal cycle dominates the ocean record, with melt changing by a factor of about four between cool and warm extremes via a nonlinear relationship with ocean temperature. A warm phase that peaked around 2009 coincided with ice-shelf thinning and retreat of the grounding line, which re-advanced during a post-2011 cool phase. These observations demonstrate how discontinuous ice retreat is linked with ocean variability, and that the strength and timing of decadal extremes is more influential than changes in the longer-term mean state. The nonlinear response of melting to temperature change heightens the sensitivity of Amundsen Sea ice shelves to such variability, possibly explaining the vulnerability of the ice sheet in that sector, where subsurface ocean temperatures are relatively high.},

To characterize the effects of this new, high-resolution GrIS mass balance, we study the time-variations of various geophysical quantities in response to the current mass loss. They include vertical uplift and subsidence, geoid height variations, global patterns of sea level change (or ﬁngerprints), and regional sea level variations along the coasts of Greenland. Long-wavelength uplifts and gravity variations in response to current or past ice thickness variations are obtained solving the sea level equation, which accounts for both the elastic and the viscoelastic components of deformation. To capture the short-wavelength components of vertical uplift in response to current ice mass loss, which is not resolved by satellite gravity observations, we have speciﬁcally developed a high-resolution regional elastic rebound (ER) model. The elastic component of vertical uplift is combined with estimates of the viscoelastic displacement ﬁelds associated with the process of glacial-isostatic adjustment (GIA), according to a set of published ice chronologies and associated mantle rheological proﬁles. We compare the sensitivity of global positioning system (GPS) observations along the coasts of Greenland to the ongoing ER and GIA. In notable contrast with past reports, we show that vertical velocities obtained by GPS data from ﬁve stations with sufﬁciently long records and from one tide gauge at the GrIS margins can be reconciled with model predictions based on the ICE-5G deglaciation model and the ER associated with the new ICESat-derived mass balance.},

We compute “far-field” vertical and horizontal deformation rates that occurred in response to early 21st century mass flux from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, global glaciers and ice caps, and associated ocean loading. We demonstrate that mass changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet and high latitude glacier systems each generated average crustal motion of 0.1–0.4 mm/yr across much of the Northern Hemisphere, with significant year-to-year variability in magnitude and direction. Horizontal motions associated with ice-mass loss exceed vertical rates in many far-field areas, and both should be considered in future analysis of GNSS measurements.},

However, to achieve this ﬁt requires estimation of an admittance for the dynamical and steric contribution, possibly due to the coarse resolution of this analysis or to simpliﬁcations associated with parameterization of bottom friction in the shallow coastal areas. The acceleration from ice loss alone is equivalent to a regional sea level rise in one century of 0.2 m in the north and 0.75 m in the south of this region.},

	title = {Glacial-isostatic contributions to present-day sea-level change around {Greenland}},
	abstract = {Present-day sea-level change around Greenland is examined by assessing the role played by glacial-isostatic adjustment (GIA). We consider the contributions from: (1) the ongoing GIA due to changes in the extent and thickness of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), (2) the equivalent signal associated with the continental ice masses located outside of Greenland, and (3) present-day changes in the GIS. Changes in the GIS arising from the last glacial-interglacial transition generally result in falling sea level today. The contribution from ice-load changes outside of Greenland causes rising sea level, owing to Greenland’s location on the collapsing forebulge that surrounds the former North American ice sheets. Combining predictions of these contributions gives results showing rising sea level in the southwest and falling sea level in the north and east. However, this is strongly dependent upon the neoglacial part of the GIS’s history. The present-day behaviour of the GIS is predicted to cause falling sea level with rates of several mm yr−1 around areas experiencing the larger ice-load changes. The available tide-gauge data are considered unusable by the standards of many workers. Nevertheless, we compare rates of local sea-level change inferred from this type of data with our predictions. In Southern Greenland, where the tide-gauge stations are located, sea level is predicted to be rising at a rate of 4 to 5 mm yr−1. Our predictions match most of the rates obtained from the tide-gauge time series, with the exception of Qaqortoq where the inferred rates may also reﬂect additional oceanic and meteorological eﬀects. Similarly, our predictions are consistent with GPS observations, with again the exception of Qaqortoq.},

State-of-the-art operational nowcasting methods typically advect precipitation fields with radar-based wind estimates, and struggle to capture important non-linear events such as convective initiations3,4. Recently introduced deep learning methods use radar to directly predict future rain rates, free of physical constraints5,6. While they accurately predict low-intensity rainfall, their operational utility is limited because their lack of constraints produces blurry nowcasts at longer lead times, yielding poor performance on rarer medium-to-heavy rain events. Here we present a deep generative model for the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation from radar that addresses these challenges. Using statistical, economic and cognitive measures, we show that our method provides improved forecast quality, forecast consistency and forecast value. Our model produces realistic and spatiotemporally consistent predictions over regions up to 1,536 km × 1,280 km and with lead times from 5–90 min ahead. Using a systematic evaluation by more than 50 expert meteorologists, we show that our generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89\% of cases against two competitive methods. When verified quantitatively, these nowcasts are skillful without resorting to blurring. We show that generative nowcasting can provide probabilistic predictions that improve forecast value and support operational utility, and at resolutions and lead times where alternative methods struggle.},

The lake is sealed until it reaches a critical level which enables it to lift the glacier, helped by a hydrostatic cantilever effect. The differential equations for non-steady water flow in a subglacial tunnel are derived and applied to the 1972 Grímsvötn outburst. The discharge: time relation observed during the growth stage, and the abrupt ending of the flood, are both very well accounted for by a theory which is insensitive to the details of the subglacial tunnel system. The steady state, in which an intergranular vein or tunnel is simultaneously melted open by frictional heat and closed by plastic deformation, may be stable or unstable according to the conditions imposed at the ends. This explains why the flow of water in a vein does not normally increase unstably as in a jökulhlaup. An ice-dammed lake does not drain away through the vein system because the driving force on the vein-water is towards the lake rather than away from it.

      Résumé
      On examine la physique des écoulements d'eau à l'intérieur et sous les glaciers avec une attention spéciale pour les débâcles catastrophiques périodiques d'eau (jökulhlaups) dûes aux vidanges du lac sous-glaciaire de Grímsvötn, Vatnajökull en Islande. Le lac est obstrué jusqu'à ce qu'il atteigne un niveau critique qui le rende capable de soulever le glacier à l'aide d'un effet hydrostatique en encorbellement. Les équations différentielles pour l'écoulement de l'eau non-permanent par un chenal sous-glaciaire sont établies et appliquées à la vidange du Grimsvötn en 1972. Le débit: sa variation en fonction du temps pendant la période de crue, l'arrêt brusque du flot, sont deux phénomènes dont la théorie rend très bien compte, bien qu'elle soit insensible au détail du réseau hydrologique sous-glaciaire. L'état d'équilibre dans lequel une canalicule intergranulaire ou un tunnel sous-glaciaire est à la fois ouvert par la fusion née de la chaleur de frottement et fermé par la déformation plastique de la glace peut être stable ou instable selon les conditions imposées aux extrémités. Ceci explique pourquoi l'écoulement d'eau dans une canalicule ne croît normalement pas comme dans un jökulhlaup. Un lac fermé par de la glace ne se vide pas à travers le réseau de canalicules intergranulàircs parce que la force prédominante s'exerçant sur l'eau des canalicules la pousse vers le lac plutôt que vers l'extérieur.

      Zusammenfassung
      Die Physik der Wasserführung in und unter Gletschereis wird besonders im Hinblick auf die periodischen, katastrophalen Wasserausbrüche (Gletscherläufe) des subglazialen Grímsvötn-Sees am Vatnajökull in Island untersucht. Der See ist abgedämmt, bis er einen kritischen Stand erreicht, bei dem er den Gletscher mit Unterstützung eines hydrostatischen Ausleger-Effektes heben kann. Die Differentialgleichungen für eine nicht-stationäre Wasserströmung in einem subglazialen Tunnel werden hergeleitet und auf den Grimsvötn-Ausbruch von 1972 angewandt. Das Verhältnis von Ausfluss und Zeit, das während der Zunahmephase zu beobachten war, und das abrupte Ende der Flut lassen sich sehr gut mit einer Theorie erfassen, die unabhängig von der Detailstruktur des subglazialen Tunnelsystems ist. Der stationäre Zustand, bei dem eine intergranulare Ader oder Öffnung zugleich durch Reibungswärme aufgeschmolzen und durch plastische Verformung geschlossen wird, kann je nach den an den Enden herrschenden Bedingungen stabil oder instabil sein. Dies erklärt, warum die Wasserführung in einer Ader gewöhnlich nicht so instabil zunimmt wie bei einem Gletscherlauf. Ein eisgedämmter See fliesst durch das Adersystem deshalb nicht aus, weil die Druckkraft auf das Aderwasser eher gegen den See hin gerichtet ist als von ihm weg.},

	abstract = {In this study, we compare gridded snow depth estimates from the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) with snow depth observations derived from GPS interferometric reflectometry (GPS-IR) from roughly 100 Plate Boundary Observatory sites in the Western United States spanning four water-years (2010–2013). Data from these sites are not assimilated by SNODAS; thus, GPS-IR measurements provide an independent data set to evaluate SNODAS. Our results indicate that at 80\% of the sites, SNODAS and GPS-IR snow depth agree to better than 15-cm root mean square error, with correlation coefficients greater than 0.6. Significant differences are found between GPS-IR and SNODAS for sites that are distant from other point measurements, are located in complex terrain or are in areas with strong vegetation heterogeneities. GPS-IR estimates of snow depth are shown to provide useful error characterization of SNODAS products across much of the Western United States and may have potential as an additional data assimilation source that could help improve SNODAS estimates. © 2014 The Authors.

	abstract = {GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) multipath has been subject to scientific research for decades and although numerous methods and techniques have already been developed to mitigate this effect, it is still one of the accuracy-limiting factors in many GNSS applications. Since multipath is highly dependent on the individual antenna environment, there is still a need for new methods and further investigations to increase the understanding of this systematic effect. In this paper, the concept of Fresnel zones is applied to two different aspects of multipath. First, Fresnel zones are determined for the line-of-sight transmission between satellite and receiver. By comparing the boundary of the Fresnel zones to an obstruction adaptive elevation mask, potentially diffracted signals can be identified and excluded from the position estimation process. Both the percentage of epochs with fixed ambiguities and the positioning accuracy can be increased by the proposed method. Second, Fresnel zones are used to analyze the multipath induced by a horizontal and spatially-limited reflector. The comparison of simulated and real signal-to-noise (SNR) observations reveals a relationship between the percentage of the overlap of the Fresnel zone and reflector and the occurrence of multipath. It is found that an overlap of 50\% is sufficient to induce multipath effects. This is of special interest, since this does not confirm theoretical assumptions of the multipath theory.},

	abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have been routinely used for geodetic-based survey and mapping studies such as precise point positioning, landslide, earthquake and crustal deformation monitoring, engineering surveys, in short, where accurate positioning is required. To do that, the GNSS observables should be eliminated from the error sources. Among the error sources affected to GNSS data, multipath stands for one of the largest error sources and should be removed. This multipath affects the strength of received microwave signal or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is recorded at the GNSS antenna. As of now, many studies are successfully conducted to retrieve reflector height from signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data gathered with a geodetic GNSS receiver. However, GNSS SNR data collected from a smartphone may also show a pattern for interferences of the direct and reflected signals from where the aforementioned heights are retrieved. In this study, an experimental site was setup to retrieve effective reflector height from a permanent mast attaching both smartphone with single frequency and geodetic GNSS receiver. The GNSS SNR data were gathered by the same time interval for a specific vertical height from the ground for three days and for approximately 5-h daily observation durations. The validation of the estimated reflector heights was performed by the root mean square error (RMSE) analysis. The RMSEs of estimated reflector heights for Xiaomi Mi 8 Lite and Trimble NetR9 geodetic receiver are computed as 1.9 and 3.7 cm, respectively. The initial results show that the outcomes of the analysis agree well with whether the in-situ measurements or the mean values via RMSEs. According to the performance assessments for accurate height detection and cost efficiency, single-frequency smartphones can be used to extract the reflector height from the collected raw SNR data.},

The Glen law is attributed to grain-size-insensitive dislocation creep; however, laboratory and field studies demonstrate that deformation in ice can be strongly dependent on grain size. This has led to the hypothesis that at sufficiently low stresses, ice flow is controlled by grain boundary sliding, which explicitly incorporates the grain size dependence of ice rheology. Experimental studies find that neither dislocation creep ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{n}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 4) nor grain boundary sliding ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{n}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 1.8) have stress exponents that match the value of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{n}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 3 in the Glen law. Thus, although the Glen law provides an approximate description of ice flow in glaciers and ice sheets, its functional form is not explained by a single deformation mechanism.

The wattmeter posits that grain size is controlled by a balance between the mechanical work required for grain growth and dynamic grain size reduction. Using the wattmeter, we calculate grain size evolution in two end-member cases: (1) a 1-D shear zone and (2) as a function of depth within an ice sheet. Calculated grain sizes match both laboratory data and ice core observations for the interior of ice sheets. Finally, we show that variations in grain size with deformation conditions result in an effective stress exponent intermediate between grain boundary sliding and dislocation creep, which is consistent with a value of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{n}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}={\textless}/span{\textgreater} 3 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.5 over the range of strain rates found in most natural systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We run several transient numerical simulations applying these three perturbations individually. Our results show that ocean-induced ice-shelf thinning generates most of the observed grounding line retreat, inland speed-up, and mass loss, in agreement with previous work. We improve the agreement with observed inland speed-up and thinning by prescribing changes in ice-shelf geometry and a reduction in basal traction over areas that became ungrounded since 1995, suggesting that shelf breakups and thinning-induced reduction in basal traction play a critical role on Thwaites's dynamics, as pointed out by previous studies. These findings suggest that modeling Thwaites's future requires reliable ocean-induced melt estimates in models that respond accurately to downstream perturbations.},

GPS geodesists have long recognized that snow can affect a GPS signal, but it has not been shown that a GPS receiver placed in a standard geodetic orientation can be used to measure snow depth. In this paper, it is shown that changes in snow depth can be clearly tracked in the corresponding multipath modulation of the GPS signal. Results for two spring 2009 snowstorms in Colorado show strong agreement between GPS snow depth estimates, field measurements, and nearby ultrasonic snow depth sensors. Because there are hundreds of geodetic GPS receivers operating in snowy regions of the U.S., it is possible that GPS receivers installed for plate deformation studies, surveying, and weather monitoring could be used to also estimate snow depth.},

The abrupt collapses of the Larsen A and B ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) have been attributed to increased surface melt. However, no studies examine the timing, magnitude, and location of surface melt processes immediately preceding these disintegrations. Here we use a regional climate model and Machine Learning analyses to evaluate the influence of f\&ouml;hn wind events on the surface liquid water budget for collapsed and extant ice shelves. We find f\&ouml;hn winds caused 25\&thinsp;\% of the total annual melt in just 9 days on Larsen A which helped melt lakes surpass a critical stability depth that, we suggest, ultimately triggered collapse. By contrast, f\&ouml;hns appear to pre-condition, not trigger, Larsen B's collapse.

Here, the distinct features of a continuous, long-term (1896–2006) daily weather record from Mohonk Lake, New York, are highlighted. The site is optimal for daily climate analyses, since it has experienced negligible land-use change, no station moves, and has maintained methodological and instrumental consistency over the entire period of record. Unlike many sites, the site has always used maximum/minimum thermometers rather than shifting to the automated Maximum/Minimum Temperature Sensor. Notable results from the analysis of this record include 1) a warming trend driven largely by trends in maximum temperatures, especially during summer, 2) increasing diurnal temperature range during summer, and 3) a reduction in the number of freeze-days per year with little change in the length of the freeze-free season. These findings deviate from some regional level trends, suggesting there may be value in revisiting selected, consistently monitored, and maintained stations similar to Mohonk for focused analyses of regional climate change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

As opposed to using geodetic-standard antennas that have been used in previous GNSS-R literature, we use multiple co-located low-cost antennas to retrieve water levels via inverse modelling of signal-to-noise ratio data. The low-cost antennas are advantageous over geodetic-standard antennas not only because they are much less expensive (even when using multiple antennas in the same location) but also because they can be used for GNSS-R analysis over a greater range of satellite elevation angles. We validate our technique using arrays of four antennas at three test sites with variable tidal forcing and co-located operational tide gauges. The root mean square error between the GNSS-R and tide gauge measurements ranges from 0.69–1.16 cm when using all four antennas at each site. We find that using four antennas instead of a single antenna improves the precision by 30 \%–50 \% and preliminary analysis suggests that four appears to be the optimum number of co-located antennas. In order to obtain precise measurements, we find that it is important for the antennas to track GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellites over a wide range of azimuth angles (at least 140{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) and elevation angles (at least 30{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}).

As a result, melt rates have been estimated from parameterizations that are largely unconstrained by observations, particularly at the near-vertical termini of tidewater glaciers. With standard coefficients, these melt parameterizations predict that ambient melting (the melt away from subglacial discharge outlets) is negligible compared to discharge-driven melting for typical tidewater glaciers. Here, we present new data from LeConte Glacier, Alaska, that challenges this paradigm. Using autonomous kayaks, we observe ambient meltwater intrusions that are ubiquitous within 400 m of the terminus, and we provide the first characterization of their properties, structure, and distribution. Our results suggest that ambient melt rates are substantially higher (×100) than standard theory predicts and that ambient melting is a significant part of the total submarine melt flux. We explore modifications to the prevalent melt parameterization to provide a path forward for improved modeling of ocean-glacier interactions.},

Future evolution could lead to deglaciation of the marine basins of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, depending on ongoing and future climate forcings, but also on basal topography/bathymetry, basal properties, and physical processes operating within the grounding zone. Hence, it is important to know the distribution of bed types of TG's interior and grounding zone, and to incorporate them accurately in models in order to improve estimates of retreat rates and stability. Here we estimate properties of the bed by determining its acoustic impedance from amplitude analysis of reflection seismic data. We report on the results from two lines – a longitudinal (L-Line) and a transverse (N-Line) – on a central flowline of TG ∼100 km inland from the grounding zone. The data show considerable spatial variability in bed forms and properties, similar to results from a comparable survey farther inland. Notably, we find the same pattern here of hard (presumed bedrock) material on the stoss side of bumps and soft (presumed till) on the lee side. Physical understanding indicates the basal flow law describing motion over different regions of TG's bed likely varies from nearly-viscous over the bedrock regions to nearly-plastic over till regions, providing guidance for modeling.},

Given that wet bedrock has higher reflectivity than dry bedrock, the wetness of the ice–bed interface can be assessed using radar echoes from the bedrock. But, since basal conditions depend on heat transfer forced by climate but lagged by the thick ice, the basal ice may currently be frozen whereas in the past it was generally melting. For that reason, the risk of bias between present and past conditions has to be evaluated. The objective of this study is to assess which locations in the Dome C area could have been protected from basal melting at any time in the past, which requires evaluating GF. We used an inverse approach to retrieve GF from radar-inferred distribution of wet and dry beds. A 1-D heat model is run over the last 800 ka to constrain the value of GF by assessing a critical ice thickness, i.e. the minimum ice thickness that would allow the present local distribution of basal melting. A regional map of the GF was then inferred over a 80 km × 130 km area, with a N–S gradient and with values ranging from 48 to 60 mW m$^{\textrm{−2}}$. The forward model was then emulated by a polynomial function to compute a time-averaged value of the spatially variable basal melt rate over the region. Three main subregions appear to be free of basal melting, two because of a thin overlying ice and one, north of Dome C, because of a low GF.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This is due to the difﬁculty in both observing small-scale bed properties and predicting a time-varying water pressure on which basal motion putatively depends. We take a Bayesian approach to these problems by coupling models of ice dynamics and subglacial hydrology and conditioning on observations of surface velocity in southwestern Greenland to infer the posterior probability distributions for eight spatially and temporally constant parameters governing the behavior of both the sliding law and hydrologic model. Because the model is computationally expensive, classical MCMC sampling is intractable. We skirt this issue by training a neural network as a surrogate that approximates the model at a sliver of the computational cost. We ﬁnd that surface velocity observations establish strong constraints on model parameters relative to a prior distribution and also elucidate correlations, while the model explains 60 \% of observed variance. However, we also ﬁnd that several distinct conﬁgurations of the hydrologic system and stress regime are consistent with observations, underscoring the need for continued data collection and model development.},

Melt lakes have been implicated in ice shelf collapse; Antarctica's Larsen B Ice Shelf was observed to have a large amount of surface melt lakes present preceding its collapse in 2002. Such collapse can affect ocean circulation and temperature, cause habitat loss and contribute to sea level rise through the acceleration of tributary glaciers. We present a mathematical model of a surface melt lake on an idealized ice shelf. The model incorporates a calculation of the ice shelf surface energy balance, heat transfer through the firn, the production and percolation of meltwater into the firn, the formation of ice lenses, and the development and refreezing of surface melt lakes. The model is applied to the Larsen C Ice Shelf, where melt lakes have been observed. This region has warmed several times the global average over the last century and the Larsen C firn layer could become saturated with meltwater by the end of the century. When forced with weather station data, our model produces surface melting, meltwater accumulation, and melt lake development consistent with observations. We examine the sensitivity of lake formation to uncertain parameters and provide evidence of the importance of processes such as lateral meltwater transport. We conclude that melt lakes impact surface melt and firn density and warrant inclusion in dynamic-thermodynamic models of ice shelf evolution within climate models, of which our model could form the basis for the thermodynamic component.},

	abstract = {The aims of this review are to: (a) describe and interpret structures in valley glaciers in relation to strain history; and (b) to explore how these structures inform our understanding of the kinematics of large ice masses, and a wide range of other aspects of glaciology. Structures in glaciers give insight as to how ice deforms at the macroscopic and larger scale. Structures also provide information concerning the deformation history of ice masses over centuries and millennia. From a geological perspective, glaciers can be considered to be models of rock deformation, but with rates of change that are measurable on a human time-scale. However, structural assemblages in glaciers are commonly complex, and unraveling them to determine the deformation history is challenging; it thus requires the approach of the structural geologist. A wide range of structures are present in valley glaciers: (a) primary structures include sedimentary stratification and various veins; (b) secondary structures that are the result of brittle and ductile deformation include crevasses, faults, crevasse traces, foliation, folds, and boudinage structures. Some of these structures, notably crevasses, relate well to measured strain-rates, but to explain ductile structures analysis of cumulative strain is required. Some structures occur in all glaciers irrespective of size, and they are therefore recognizable in ice streams and ice shelves. Structural approaches have wide (but as yet under-developed potential) application to other sub-disciplines of glaciology, notably glacier hydrology, debris entrainment and transfer, landform development, microbiological investigations, and in the interpretation of glacier-like features on Mars.},

Using the observed tidal deformation, the true base was found to lie at 1,910–1,950-m depth, at 350–400 m greater range than the first reflection from an ice-ocean interface. The robustness of the basal melt rate estimate was increased by using multiple basal reflections over the radar footprint, yielding a melt rate of 22 ± 2.1 m a−1. The ApRES estimate is over 40\% lower than the three existing satellite estimates covering Totten Ice Shelf. This difference in basal melt is dynamically significant and highlights the need for independent melt rate estimates using complementary instrumentation and techniques that rely on different sets of assumptions.},

Stratigraphic layers across the grounding line show, in places, a large-amplitude downwarp at, or slightly downstream of, the grounding line due to sub-ice-shelf basal melting. Localized downwarping indicates that melting is transient; melt rates, or the grounding line position, have changed within a few hundred years in order to produce the observed stratigraphy. Elsewhere, no melt-related stratigraphic signature is preserved. In part, heterogeneity in the amount of sub-ice-shelf melt is due to regional circulation patterns in the sub-shelf cavity, but local (on the order of tens of kilometers) heterogeneity in the melt pattern may reflect small differences in the shape of the ice-shelf base at the grounding line.

The Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica has recently developed new rifts, which are being actively monitored as they lengthen and interact with the internal structure of the ice shelf. Here we present the results of a ground-penetrating radar survey of the Brunt Ice Shelf aimed at understanding variations in the internal structure. We find that there are flow bands composed mostly of thick (ca. 250\&thinsp;m) meteoric ice interspersed with thinner (ca. 150\&thinsp;m) sections of ice shelf that have a large proportion of sea ice and seawater-saturated firn. Therefore the ice shelf is, in essence, a series of ice tongues cemented together with ice mélange. The changes in structure are related both to the thickness and flow speed of ice at the grounding line and to subsequent processes of firn accumulation and brine infiltration as the ice shelf flows towards the calving front. It is shown that rifts propagating through the Brunt Ice Shelf preferentially skirt the edges of blocks of meteoric ice and slow their rate of propagation when forced by the stress field to break through them, in contrast to the situation on other ice shelves where rift propagation speeds up in meteoric ice.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

They are present in many Antarctic ice shelves and can reduce ice-shelf structural integrity, potentially destabilizing ice shelves by full-depth incision. Here, we describe the viscous ice response to a basal channel—secondary flow—which acts perpendicular to the channel axis and is induced by gradients in ice thickness. We use a full-Stokes ice-flow model to systematically assess the transient evolution of a basal channel in the presence of melting. Secondary flow increases with channel size and reduces the rate of channel incision, such that linear extrapolation or the Shallow-Shelf Approximation cannot project future channel evolution. For thick ice shelves ( m) secondary flow potentially stabilizes the channel, but is insufficient to significantly delay breakthrough for thinner ice ( m). Using synthetic data, we assess the impact of secondary flow when inferring basal-channel melt rates from satellite observations.},

Despite a more than 100-year history of use, many existing varve counting techniques are time consuming and difficult to reproduce. We present countMYvarves, a varve counting toolbox which uses sliding-window autocorrelation to count the number of repeated patterns in core scans or outcrop photos. The toolbox is used to build an annually-resolved record of sedimentation rates, which are depth-integrated to provide ages. We validate the model with repeated manual counts of a high sedimentation rate lake with biogenic varves (Herd Lake, USA) and a low sedimentation rate glacial lake (Lago Argentino, Argentina). In both cases, countMYvarves is consistent with manual counts and provides additional sedimentation rate data. The toolbox performs multiple simultaneous varve counts, enabling uncertainty to be quantified and propagated into the resulting age-depth model. The toolbox also includes modules to automatically exclude non-varved portions of sediment and interpolate over missing or disrupted sediment.

	abstract = {Ice shelves around Antarctica can provide back stress for outlet glaciers and control ice sheet mass loss. They often contain narrow bands of thin ice termed ice shelf channels. Ice shelf channel morphology can be interpreted through surface depressions and exhibits junctions and deflections from flowlines. Using ice flow modeling and radar, we investigate ice shelf channels in the Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf. These are aligned obliquely to the prevailing easterly winds. In the shallow radar stratigraphy, syncline and anticline stacks occur beneath the upwind and downwind side, respectively. The structures are horizontally and vertically coherent, except near an ice shelf channel junction where patterns change structurally with depth. Deeper layers truncate near basal incisions. Using ice flow modeling, we show that the stratigraphy is ∼9 times more sensitive to atmospheric variability than to oceanic variability. This is due to the continual adjustment toward flotation. We propose that syncline-anticline pairs in the shallow stratigraphy are caused by preferential snow deposition on the windward side and wind erosion at the downwind side. This drives downwind deflection of ice shelf channels of several meters per year. The depth variable structures indicate formation of an ice shelf channel junction by basal melting. We conclude that many ice shelf channels are seeded at the grounding line. Their morphology farther seaward is shaped on different length scales by ice dynamics, the ocean, and the atmosphere. These processes act on finer (subkilometer) scales than are captured by most ice, atmosphere, and ocean models, yet the dynamics of ice shelf channels may have broader implications for ice shelf stability.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty remains about how the surface hydrology of the Greenland ice sheet influences its subglacial drainage system, affecting basal water pressures and ice velocities, particularly over intraseasonal and interseasonal timescales. Here we apply a high spatial (200 m) and temporal (1 h) resolution subglacial hydrological model to a marginal (extending 25 km inland), land-terminating, 200 km2 domain in the Paakitsoq region, West Greenland. The model is based on that by Hewitt (2013) but adapted for use with both real topographic boundary conditions and calibrated modeled water inputs. The inputs consist of moulin hydrographs, calculated by a surface routing and lake-filling/draining model, which is forced with distributed runoff from a surface energy-balance model. Results suggest that the areal density of lake-bottom moulins and their timing of opening during the melt season strongly affects subglacial drainage system development. A higher moulin density causes an earlier onset of subglacial channelization (i.e., water transport through channels rather than the distributed sheet), which becomes relatively widespread across the bed, whereas a lower moulin density results in a later onset of channelization that becomes less widespread across the bed. In turn, moulin density has a strong control on spatial and temporal variations in subglacial water pressures, which will influence basal sliding rates, and thus ice motion. The density of active surface-to-bed connections should be considered alongside surface melt intensity and extent in future predictions of the ice sheet's dynamics.},

Ice rises typically rise several hundreds of meters above the surrounding ice shelf; shelf flow is diverted around them. On the other hand, shelf ice flows across ice rumples, which typically rise only a few tens of meters above the ice shelf. Ice rises contain rich histories of deglaciation and climate that extend back over timescales ranging from a few millennia to beyond the last glacial maximum. Numerical model results have shown that the buttressing effects of ice rises and rumples are significant, but details of processes and how they evolve remain poorly understood. Fundamental information about the conditions and processes that cause transitions between floating ice shelves, ice rises and ice rumples is needed in order to assess their impact on ice-sheet behavior.

Sea level is therefore expected to rise due to Antarctic contributions, but uncertainties in its amount and timing remain largely unquantified. In particular, there is substantial uncertainty in future basal melt rates arising from multi-model differences in thermal forcing and how melt rates depend on that thermal forcing. To facilitate uncertainty quantification in sea level rise projections, we build, validate, and demonstrate projections from a computationally efficient statistical emulator of a high-resolution (4 km) Antarctic ice sheet model, the Community Ice Sheet Model version 2.1. The emulator is trained to a large (500-member) ensemble of 200-year-long 4 km resolution transient ice sheet simulations, whereby regional basal melt rates are perturbed by idealized (yet physically informed) trajectories. The main advantage of our emulation approach is that by sampling a wide range of possible basal melt trajectories, the emulator can be used to (1) produce probabilistic sea level rise projections over much larger Monte Carlo ensembles than are possible by direct numerical simulation alone, thereby providing better statistical characterization of uncertainties, and (2) predict the simulated ice sheet response under differing assumptions about basal melt characteristics as new oceanographic studies are published, without having to run additional numerical ice sheet simulations. As a proof of concept, we propagate uncertainties about future basal melt rate trajectories, derived from regional ocean models, to generate probabilistic sea level rise estimates for 100 and 200 years into the future.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Combining these data with dynamic ice sheet models may greatly aid model calibration, improve past and future sea level estimates, and enable insights into past ice sheet dynamics that neither models nor data could achieve alone. Unfortunately, simulating the continental-scale ice sheet stratigraphy represents a major challenge for current ice sheet models. In this study, we present the first three-dimensional ice sheet model that explicitly simulates the Greenland englacial stratigraphy. Individual layers of accumulation are represented on a grid whose vertical axis is time so that they do not exchange mass with each other as the flow of ice deforms them. This isochronal advection scheme does not influence the ice dynamics and only requires modest input data from a host thermomechanical ice sheet model, making it easy to transfer to a range of models. Using an ensemble of simulations, we show that direct comparison with the dated radiostratigraphy data yields notably more accurate results than calibrating simulations based on total ice thickness. We show that the isochronal scheme produces a more reliable simulation of the englacial age profile than traditional age tracers. The interpretation of ice dynamics at different times is possible but limited by uncertainties in the upper and lower boundary conditions, namely temporal variations in surface mass balance and basal friction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Yelmo is a thermomechanical model, solving for the coupled velocity and temperature solutions of an ice sheet simultaneously. The ice dynamics are currently treated via a “hybrid” approach combining the shallow-ice and shallow-shelf/shelfy-stream approximations, which makes Yelmo an apt choice for studying a wide variety of problems. Yelmo's main innovations lie in its flexible and user-friendly infrastructure, which promotes portability and facilitates long-term development. In particular, all physics subroutines have been designed to be self-contained, so that they can be easily ported from Yelmo to other models, or easily replaced by improved or alternate methods in the future. Furthermore, hard-coded model choices are eschewed, replaced instead with convenient parameter options that allow the model to be adapted easily to different contexts. We show results for different ice-sheet benchmark tests, and we illustrate Yelmo's performance for the Antarctic ice sheet.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Pattern recognition tasks such as classification, object detection, and segmentation (i.e., pixel-level classification) have remained challenging problems in the weather and climate sciences. While there exist many empirical heuristics for detecting extreme events, the disparities between the output of these different methods even for a single event are large and often difficult to reconcile. Given the success of deep learning (DL) in tackling similar problems in computer vision, we advocate a DL-based approach. DL, however, works best in the context of supervised learning – when labeled datasets are readily available. Reliable labeled training data for extreme weather and climate events is scarce.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We create “ClimateNet” – an open, community-sourced human-expert-labeled curated dataset that captures tropical cyclones (TCs) and atmospheric rivers (ARs) in high-resolution climate model output from a simulation of a recent historical period.

We then apply the trained DL model to historical and climate change scenarios simulated by the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM5.1) and show that the DL model accurately segments the data into TCs, ARs, or “the background” at a pixel level. Further, we show how the segmentation results can be used to conduct spatially and temporally precise analytics by quantifying distributions of extreme precipitation conditioned on event types (TC or AR) at regional scales.

New developments in this framework include an off-line volume-conservative mapping to a cubed-sphere grid, improvements to the CNN architecture and the minimization of the loss function over multiple steps in a prediction sequence. The cubed-sphere remapping minimizes the distortion on the cube faces on which convolution operations are performed and provides natural boundary conditions for padding in the CNN. Our improved model produces weather forecasts that are indefinitely stable and produce realistic weather patterns at lead times of several weeks and longer. For short- to medium-range forecasting, our model significantly outperforms persistence, climatology, and a coarse-resolution dynamical numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Unsurprisingly, our forecasts are worse than those from a high-resolution state-of-the-art operational NWP system. Our data-driven model is able to learn to forecast complex surface temperature patterns from few input atmospheric state variables. On annual time scales, our model produces a realistic seasonal cycle driven solely by the prescribed variation in top-of-atmosphere solar forcing. Although it currently does not compete with operational weather forecasting models, our data-driven CNN executes much faster than those models, suggesting that machine learning could prove to be a valuable tool for large-ensemble forecasting.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Ice sheet models differ in their numerical treatment of dynamical processes. Simulations of marine-based ice are sensitive to the choice of Stokes flow approximation and basal friction law and to the treatment of stresses and melt rates near the grounding line. We study the effects of these numerical choices on marine ice sheet dynamics in the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM). In the framework of the Marine Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project 3d (MISMIP3d), we show that a depth-integrated, higher-order solver gives results similar to a 3D (Blatter–Pattyn) solver. We confirm that using a grounding line parameterization to approximate stresses in the grounding zone leads to accurate representation of ice sheet flow with a resolution of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼2{\textless}/span{\textgreater} km, as opposed to {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼0.5{\textless}/span{\textgreater} km without the parameterization. In the MISMIP+ experimental framework, we compare different treatments of sub-shelf melting near the grounding line. In contrast to recent studies arguing that melting should not be applied in partly grounded cells, it is usually beneficial in CISM simulations to apply some melting in these cells. This suggests that the optimal treatment of melting near the grounding line can depend on ice sheet geometry, forcing, or model numerics. In both experimental frameworks, ice flow is sensitive to the choice of basal friction law. To study this sensitivity, we evaluate friction laws that vary the connectivity between the basal hydrological system and the ocean near the grounding line. CISM yields accurate results in steady-state and perturbation experiments at a resolution of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼2{\textless}/span{\textgreater} km (arguably 4 km) when the connectivity is low or moderate and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼1{\textless}/span{\textgreater} km (arguably 2 km) when the connectivity is strong.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This work occurs at the intersection of glaciology and climate science and is motivated by a need for robust projections of sea-level rise. The Community Ice Sheet Model version 2 (CISM2) is the newest component model of the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). This study describes the coupling and novel capabilities of the model, including: (1) an advanced energy-balance-based surface mass balance calculation in the land component with downscaling via elevation classes; (2) a closed freshwater budget from ice sheet to the ocean from surface runoff, basal melting, and ice discharge; (3) dynamic land surface types; and (4) dynamic atmospheric topography. The Earth system/ice-sheet coupling is demonstrated in a simulation with an evolving Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) under an idealized high CO2 scenario. The model simulates a large expansion of ablation areas (where surface ablation exceeds snow accumulation) and a large increase in surface runoff. This results in an elevated freshwater flux to the ocean, as well as thinning of the ice sheet and area retreat. These GrIS changes result in reduced Greenland surface albedo, changes in the sign and magnitude of sensible and latent heat fluxes, and modified surface roughness and overall ice sheet topography. Representation of these couplings between climate and ice sheets is key for the simulation of ice and climate interactions.},

	abstract = {We explore the potential of feed-forward deep neural networks (DNNs) for emulating cloud superparameterization in realistic geography, using offline fits to data from the superparameterized community atmospheric model. To identify the network architecture of greatest skill, we formally optimize hyperparameters using ∼250 trials. Our DNN explains over 70\% of the temporal variance at the 15-min sampling scale throughout the mid-to-upper troposphere. Autocorrelation timescale analysis compared against DNN skill suggests the less good fit in the tropical, marine boundary layer is driven by neural network difficulty emulating fast, stochastic signals in convection. However, spectral analysis in the temporal domain indicates skillful emulation of signals on diurnal to synoptic scales. A closer look at the diurnal cycle reveals correct emulation of land-sea contrasts and vertical structure in the heating and moistening fields, but some distortion of precipitation. Sensitivity tests targeting precipitation skill reveal complementary effects of adding positive constraints versus hyperparameter tuning, motivating the use of both in the future. A first attempt to force an offline land model with DNN emulated atmospheric fields produces reassuring results further supporting neural network emulation viability in real-geography settings. Overall, the fit skill is competitive with recent attempts by sophisticated Residual and Convolutional Neural Network architectures trained on added information, including memory of past states. Our results confirm the parameterizability of superparameterized convection with continents through machine learning and we highlight the advantages of casting this problem locally in space and time for accurate emulation and hopefully quick implementation of hybrid climate models.},

Reduction in ice-shelf buttressing caused by increased ocean-induced melt along their undersides is now understood to be one of the key drivers of ice loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. However, despite the importance of this forcing mechanism most ice-sheet simulations currently rely on simple melt-parametrisations of this ocean-driven process, since a fully coupled ice-ocean modelling framework is prohibitively computationally expensive. Here, we provide an alternative approach that is able to capture the greatly improved physical description of this process provided by large-scale ocean-circulation models over currently employed melt-parameterisations but with trivial computational expense. We introduce a new approach that brings together deep learning and physical modelling to develop a deep neural network framework, MELTNET, that can emulate ocean model predictions of sub-ice shelf melt rates. We train MELTNET on synthetic geometries, using the NEMO ocean model as a ground-truth in lieu of observations to provide melt rates both for training and to evaluate the performance of the trained network. We show that MELTNET can accurately predict melt rates for a wide range of complex synthetic geometries and outperforms more traditional parameterisations for \&gt; 95 \% of geometries tested. Furthermore, we find MELTNET's melt rate estimates show sensitivity to established physical relationships such as a changes in thermal forcing and ice shelf slope. This study demonstrates the potential for a deep learning framework to calculate melt rates with almost no computational expense, that could in the future be used in conjunction with an ice sheet model to provide predictions for large-scale ice sheet models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We advanced a state-of-the-art GAN called pix2pixHD, such that it produces imagery that is physically-consistent with the output of an expert-validated storm surge model (NOAA SLOSH). By evaluating the imagery relative to physics-based flood maps, we find that our proposed framework outperforms baseline models in both physical-consistency and photorealism. We envision our work to be the first step towards a global visualization of how climate change shapes our landscape. Continuing on this path, we show that the proposed pipeline generalizes to visualize arctic sea ice melt. We also publish a dataset of over 25k labelled image-pairs to study image-to-image translation in Earth observation.},

	abstract = {In airborne radargrams, undulating periodic patterns in amplitude that overprint traditional radiostratigraphic layering are occasionally observed, however, they have yet to be analyzed from a geophysical or glaciological perspective. We present evidence supported by theory that these depth-periodic patterns are consistent with a modulation of the received radar power due to the birefringence of polar ice, and therefore indicate the presence of bulk fabric anisotropy. Here, we investigate the periodic component of birefringence-induced radar power recorded in airborne radar data at the eastern shear margin of Thwaites Glacier and quantify the lateral variation in azimuthal fabric strength across this margin. We find the depth variability of birefringence periodicity crossing the shear margin to be a visual expression of its shear state and its development, which appears consistent with present-day ice deformation. The morphology of the birefringent patterns is centered at the location of maximum shear and observed in all cross-margin profiles, consistent with predictions of ice fabric when subjected to simple shear. The englacial fabric appears stronger inside the ice stream than outward of the shear margin. The detection of birefringent periodicity from non-polarimetric radargrams presents a novel use of subsurface radar to constrain lateral variations in fabric strength, locate present and past shear margins, and characterize the deformation history of polar ice sheets.},

There is a large amount of heterogeneous radar data from the polar regions that have been gathered through expensive missions. However, retrieving meaningful information from this large volume of data is still a great challenge. With the advancement of machine learning techniques in recent years, many scientists are eager to take advantage of these algorithms and techniques to explore and mine Arctic and Antarctic data. These advancements, however, have happened mainly in the area of supervised learning where the models are data hungry and require large amounts of annotated data. Generating simulated data can be an effective and inexpensive approach to provide large labeled datasets for training machine learning models. In this work, we explore two approaches to simulate arctic snow radar echogram images, namely a radar scattering physics based approach combined with some statistical measures and a purely data-driven approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network. Using several image comparison metrics, we analyze the utility of both methods for the purpose of simulating echograms. Our results show that the physics simulator generates images with good structural similarities, while the purely data-driven approach achieves better textural similarities for simulated image. Finally, we also show that by augmenting our real dataset by the simulated echograms, we can improve our deep learning model for tracking internal layers of snow.},

As a result, a wide array of orbital, airborne, ground-based, and in situ instruments, platforms and data analysis approaches for radioglaciology have been developed, applied or proposed. Terrestrially, airborne radar sounding has been used in glaciology to observe ice thickness, basal topography and englacial layers for five decades. More recently, radar sounding data have also been exploited to estimate the extent and configuration of subglacial water, the geometry of subglacial bedforms and the subglacial and englacial thermal states of ice sheets. Planetary radar sounders have observed, or are planned to observe, the subsurfaces and near-surfaces of Mars, Earth's Moon, comets and the icy moons of Jupiter. In this review paper, and the thematic issue of the Annals of Glaciology on ‘Five decades of radioglaciology’ to which it belongs, we present recent advances in the fields of radar systems, missions, signal processing, data analysis, modeling and scientific interpretation.

The model is forced with daily surface runoff estimates for 2009 and 2010 across an 8,000-km2 region on the western margin. The overall subglacial drainage system morphology develops similarly in both years, with subglacial channel networks growing inland from the ice sheet margin and robust subglacial pathways forming over bedrock ridges. Modeled effective pressures are compared to contemporaneous regional surface speeds derived from TerraSAR-X imagery to investigate spatial relationships. Our results show an inverse spatial relationship between effective pressure and ice speed in the mid-melt season, when surface speeds are elevated, indicating that effective pressure is the dominant control on surface velocities in the mid-melt season. By contrast, in the early and late melt seasons, when surface speeds are slower, effective pressure and surface speed have a positive relationship. Our results suggest that outside of the mid-melt season, the influence of effective pressures on sliding speeds may be secondary to the influence of driving stress and spatially variable bed roughness.},

By the end of the century, we predict a glacier volume loss between 75 and 88\%. Deep learning captures a nonlinear response of glaciers to air temperature and precipitation, improving the representation of extreme mass balance rates compared to linear statistical and temperature-index models. Our results confirm an over-sensitivity of temperature-index models, often used by large-scale studies, to future warming. We argue that such models can be suitable for steep mountain glaciers. However, glacier projections under low-emission scenarios and the behaviour of flatter glaciers and ice caps are likely to be biased by mass balance models with linear sensitivities, introducing long-term biases in sea-level rise and water resources projections.},

Coincident with recent exceptional warming of the northwest Atlantic Ocean and removal of large predatory fish, the American lobster has become the most valuable fishery resource in North America. Using a model that links ocean temperature, predator density, and fishing to population productivity, we show that harvester-driven conservation efforts to protect large lobsters prepared the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery to capitalize on favorable ecosystem conditions, resulting in the record-breaking landings recently observed in the region. In contrast, in the warmer southern New England region, the absence of similar conservation efforts precipitated warming-induced recruitment failure that led to the collapse of the fishery. Population projections under expected warming suggest that the American lobster fishery is vulnerable to future temperature increases, but continued efforts to preserve the stock's reproductive potential can dampen the negative impacts of warming. This study demonstrates that, even though global climate change is severely impacting marine ecosystems, widely adopted, proactive conservation measures can increase the resilience of commercial fisheries to climate change.},

	abstract = {Spinning up a highly complex, coupled Earth system model (ESM) is a time consuming and computationally demanding exercise. For models with interactive ice sheet components, this becomes a major challenge, as ice sheets are sensitive to bidirectional feedback processes and equilibrate over glacial timescales of up to many millennia. This work describes and demonstrates a computationally tractable, iterative procedure for spinning up a contemporary, highly complex ESM that includes an interactive ice sheet component. The procedure alternates between a computationally expensive coupled configuration and a computationally cheaper configuration where the atmospheric component is replaced by a data model. By periodically regenerating atmospheric forcing consistent with the coupled system, the data atmosphere remains adequately constrained to ensure that the broader model state evolves realistically. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by spinning up the preindustrial climate in the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2), coupled to the Community Ice Sheet Model Version 2 (CISM2) over Greenland. The equilibrium climate state is similar to the control climate from a coupled simulation with a prescribed Greenland ice sheet, indicating that the iterative procedure is consistent with a traditional spin-up approach without interactive ice sheets. These results suggest that the iterative method presented here provides a faster and computationally cheaper method for spinning up a highly complex ESM, with or without interactive ice sheet components. The method described here has been used to develop the climate/ice sheet initial conditions for transient, ice sheet-enabled simulations with CESM2-CISM2 in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6).},

It is now more than 50 years since Tuzo Wilson published his paper asking ‘Did the Atlantic close and then re-open?’. This led to the ‘Wilson Cycle’ concept in which the repeated opening and closing of ocean basins along old orogenic belts is a key process in the assembly and breakup of supercontinents. This implied that the processes of rifting and mountain building somehow pre-conditioned and weakened the lithosphere in these regions, making them susceptible to strain localization during future deformation episodes. Here we provide a retrospective look at the development of the concept, how it has evolved over the past five decades, current thinking and future focus areas. The Wilson Cycle has proved enormously important to the theory and practice of geology and underlies much of what we know about the geological evolution of the Earth and its lithosphere. The concept will no doubt continue to be developed as we gain more understanding of the physical processes that control mantle convection and plate tectonics, and as more data become available from currently less accessible regions.},

In this review, we synthesize current understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that can give rise to AA. These mechanisms include both local feedbacks and changes in poleward energy transport. Temperature and sea ice-related feedbacks are especially important for AA, since they are significantly more positive over the Arctic than at lower latitudes. Changes in energy transport by the atmosphere and ocean can also contribute to AA. These energy transport changes are tightly coupled with local feedbacks, and thus their respective contributions to AA should not be considered in isolation.

	abstract = {The landscape hidden beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet remains one of the most sparsely mapped regions on Earth, but offers a unique record of environmental conditions prior to and during widespread glaciation, and of the ice sheet's response to changing climates. In particular, subglacial valleys observed across Greenland may preserve geomorphological information pertaining to landscape and ice sheet evolution. Here we analyze the morphology of a subglacial valley network in northern Greenland using bed elevation measurements acquired during multi-year airborne radio-echo sounding surveys. Channel profile morphologies are consistent with a primarily fluvial origin of the network, with evidence for localized modification by ice and/or meltwater. Gravity and magnetic anomalies suggest that the spatial organisation of the valley network is influenced by regional-scale geological structure, implying a long-lived and well-established hydrological system. We also document two knickzones in the valley longitudinal profile and terraces above the channel floor in the lower course of the network. These observations, combined with stream power modeling, indicate that northern Greenland experienced two episodes of relative base level fall during the Neogene (∼150 m at ca. 12–3.7 Ma and ∼380 m at ca. 8.2–2.8 Ma) that resulted in channel profile adjustment via incision and knickzone retreat. The timing of the inferred base level fall correlates with other onshore and offshore records of uplift, denudation, and/or relative sea level change, and we suggest that tectonic and/or mantle-driven uplift played an important role in the genesis of the modern landscape of northern Greenland.},

	abstract = {Ice shelf collapse could trigger widespread retreat of marine-based portions of the Antarctic ice sheet. However, little is known about the processes that control the stability of ice shelves. Recent observations have revealed that ice shelves have topographic features that span a spectrum of wavelengths, including basal channels and crevasses. Here we use ground-penetrating radar data to quantify patterns of roughness within and between ice shelves. We find that roughness follows a power law with the scaling exponent approximately constant between ice shelves. However, the level of roughness varies by nearly an order of magnitude between ice shelves. Critically, we find that roughness strongly correlates with basal melt, suggesting that increased melt not only leads to larger melt channels, but also to increased fracturing, rifting and decreased ice shelf stability. This hints that the mechanical stability of ice shelves may be more tightly controlled by ocean forcing than previously thought.},

Measurements of ice-shelf motion provide insights into processes modifying buttressing. Here we investigate the effect of seasonal variability of basal melting on ice flow of Ross Ice Shelf. Velocities were measured from November 2015 to December 2016 at 12 GPS stations deployed from the ice front to 430 km upstream. The flow-parallel velocity anomaly at each station, relative to the annual mean, was small during early austral summer (November-January), negative during February-April, and positive during austral winter (May-September). The maximum velocity anomaly reached several metres per year at most stations. We used a 2-D ice-sheet model of the RIS and its grounded tributaries to explore the seasonal response of the ice sheet to time-varying basal melt rates. We find that melt-rate response to changes in summer upper-ocean heating near the ice front will affect the future flow of RIS and its tributary glaciers. However, modelled seasonal flow variations from increased summer basal melting near the ice front are much smaller than observed, suggesting that other as-yet-unidentified seasonal processes are currently dominant.},

The simulations show turbulent upwelling and spreading of the freshwater-laden plume along the ice face and the vigorous melting of ice at rates of meters per day. The simulated August 2010 melt rate of 2.0±0.3 m/d is within uncertainties of the melt rate of 3.0±1.0 m/d calculated from oceanographic data. Melting is greatest at depth, above the subglacial channels, causing glacier undercutting. Melt rates increase proportionally to thermal forcing raised to the power of 1.2–1.6 and to subglacial water flux raised to the power of 0.5–0.9. Therefore, in a warmer climate, Store Glacier melting by ocean may increase from both increased ocean temperature and subglacial discharge.},

Dynamic ice sheet model simulations show considerable overlap in the projected Antarctic Ice Sheet sea-level contribution under various greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and the timescale at which scenario dependence will emerge is unclear. With historically constrained ice sheet simulations and a statistical emulator, we demonstrate that a high-emissions signature of the Antarctic Ice Sheet sea-level contribution will not unambiguously emerge from the wide potential range of low-emission sea-level projections for over 100 years due to current limitations in our understanding in ice flow and sliding. However, the results also indicate that the total global warming that occurs over the 21st century controls the resulting long-term Antarctic Ice Sheet sea-level commitment, with multi-meter differences between the highest and lowest emissions scenarios in subsequent centuries.},

	abstract = {The land ice contribution to global mean sea level rise has not yet been predicted1 using ice sheet and glacier models for the latest set of socio-economic scenarios, nor using coordinated exploration of uncertainties arising from the various computer models involved. Two recent international projects generated a large suite of projections using multiple models2–8, but primarily used previous-generation scenarios9 and climate models10, and could not fully explore known uncertainties. Here we estimate probability distributions for these projections under the new scenarios11,12 using statistical emulation of the ice sheet and glacier models. We find that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would halve the land ice contribution to twenty-first-century sea level rise, relative to current emissions pledges. The median decreases from 25 to 13 centimetres sea level equivalent (SLE) by 2100, with glaciers responsible for half the sea level contribution. The projected Antarctic contribution does not show a clear response to the emissions scenario, owing to uncertainties in the competing processes of increasing ice loss and snowfall accumulation in a warming climate. However, under risk-averse (pessimistic) assumptions, Antarctic ice loss could be five times higher, increasing the median land ice contribution to 42 centimetres SLE under current policies and pledges, with the 95th percentile projection exceeding half a metre even under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming. This would severely limit the possibility of mitigating future coastal flooding. Given this large range (between 13 centimetres SLE using the main projections under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming and 42 centimetres SLE using risk-averse projections under current pledges), adaptation planning for twenty-first-century sea level rise must account for a factor-of-three uncertainty in the land ice contribution until climate policies and the Antarctic response are further constrained.},

Most studies have focused on the site-selection problem to identify the best site from given potential sites in speciﬁc areas, while few have solved the site-search problem to determine the boundary of the suitable area. A GIS-based bivariate logistic regression (LR) model using the supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithm was developed for suitability classiﬁcation in this study. Eight crucial factors were selected from 27 candidate variables using stepwise methods with a training dataset in the best LR model. The variable of the proximity to residential buildings was more important than that to various commercial buildings, transport services, and roads. Among the four types of residential buildings, the most crucial factor was the proximity to residential quarters. A test dataset was employed for the validation process, showing that the best LR model had excellent performance. The results identiﬁed the suitable areas for PPLs, accounting for 8\% of the total area of Guangzhou (GZ). A decision-maker can focus on these suitable areas as the site-selection ranges for PPLs, which signiﬁcantly reduces the difﬁculty of analysis and time costs. This method can quickly decompose a large-scale area into several small-scale suitable areas, with relevance to the problem of selecting sites from various candidate sites.},

	abstract = {Observations indicate that substantial changes in the dynamics of marine-terminating ice sheets and glaciers are tightly coupled to calving-induced changes in the terminus position. However, the calving process itself remains poorly understood and is not well parametrized in current numerical ice sheet models. In this study, we address this uncertainty by deriving plausible upper and lower limits for the maximum stable ice thickness at the calving face of marine-terminating glaciers, using two complementary models. The first model assumes that a combination of tensile and shear failure can render the ice cliff near the terminus unstable and/or enable pre-existing crevasses to intersect. A direct consequence of this model is that thick glaciers must terminate in deep water to stabilize the calving front, yielding a predicted maximum ice cliff height that increases with increasing water depth, consistent with observations culled from glaciers in West Greenland, Antarctica, Svalbard and Alaska. The second model considers an analogous lower limit derived by assuming that the ice is already fractured and fractures are lubricated by pore pressure. In this model, a floating ice tongue can only form when the ice entering the terminus region is relatively intact with few pre-existing, deeply penetrating crevasses.},

We completed radar velocity analysis in the upper ∼2 m to estimate the surface and average snow density of the Greenland Ice Sheet. We parameterized the Herron and Langway (1980) firn density and age model using the radar-derived snow density, radar-derived surface mass balance (2015–2017) and reanalysis-derived temperature data. We applied structure-oriented filtering to the radar image along constant age horizons and increased the depth at which horizons could be reliably interpreted. We reconstructed the historical instantaneous surface mass balance, which we averaged into annual and multidecadal products along a 78 km traverse for the period 1984–2017. We found good agreement between our physically constrained parameterization and a firn core collected from the dry snow accumulation zone, and gained insights into the spatial correlation of surface snow density.},

To date, Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers have only been observed by independent airborne radar sounding surveys, but a combined cross-basin analysis that investigates the basal conditions across the Pine Island-Thwaites Glaciers boundary has not been performed. Here, we combine two radar surveys and correct for their differences in system parameters to produce unified englacial attenuation and basal relative reflectivity maps spanning both Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers. Relative reflectivities range from −24.8 to +37.4 dB with the highest values beneath fast-flowing ice at the ice sheet margin. By comparing our reflectivity results with previously derived radar specularity and trailing bed echoes at Thwaites Glacier, we find a highly diverse subglacial landscape and hydrologic conditions that evolve along-flow. Together, these findings highlight the potential for joint airborne radar analysis with ground-based seismic and geomorphological observations to understand variations in the bed properties and cross-catchment interactions of ice streams and outlet glaciers.},

	abstract = {It is remarkable that the high-end sea level rise threat over the next few hundred years comes almost entirely from only a handful of ice streams and large glaciers. These occupy a few percent of ice sheets’ coastline. Accordingly, spatially limited interventions at source may provide globally-equitable mitigation from rising seas. Ice streams control draining of ice sheets; glacier retreat or acceleration serves to greatly increase potential sea level rise. While various climatic geoengineering approaches have been considered, serious consideration of geotechnical approaches has been limited e particularly regarding glaciers. This study summarises novel and extant geotechnical techniques for glacier restraint, identifying candidates for further research. These include draining or freezing the bed; altering surface albedo; creating obstacles: retaining snow; stiffening shear margins with ice; blocking warm sea water entry; thickening ice shelves (increasing buttressing, and strengthening fractured shelves against disintegration); as well as using regional climate engineering or local cloud seeding to cool the glacier or add snow. Not all of these ideas are judged reasonable or feasible, and even fewer are likely to be found to be advisable after further consideration. By describing and evaluating the potential and risks of a large menu of responses e even apparently hopeless ones e we can increase the chances of ﬁnding one that works in times of need.},

            Humans’ ability to efficiently shed heat has enabled us to range over every continent, but a wet-bulb temperature (TW) of 35°C marks our upper physiological limit, and much lower values have serious health and productivity impacts. Climate models project the first 35°C TW occurrences by the mid-21st century. However, a comprehensive evaluation of weather station data shows that some coastal subtropical locations have already reported a TW of 35°C and that extreme humid heat overall has more than doubled in frequency since 1979. Recent exceedances of 35°C in global maximum sea surface temperature provide further support for the validity of these dangerously high TW values. We find the most extreme humid heat is highly localized in both space and time and is correspondingly substantially underestimated in reanalysis products. Our findings thus underscore the serious challenge posed by humid heat that is more intense than previously reported and increasingly severe.},

We delineate a broad, segmented basement high with thin (0-500m) non-magnetic sedimentary cover which trends northward into the Ross Sea’s Central High. Before subsiding in the Oligocene, this feature likely facilitated early glaciation in the region and subsequently acted as a pinning point and ice ﬂow divide. Flanking the high are wide sedimentary basins, up to 3700m deep, which parallel the Ross Sea basins and likely formed during Cretaceous-Neogene intracontinental extension. NWSE basins beneath the Siple Coast grounding zone, by contrast, are narrow, deep, and elongate. They suggest tectonic divergence upon active faults that may localize geothermal heat and/or groundwater ﬂow, both important components of the subglacial system.},

The results herein suggest that the path of this boundary current and the formation of the northern recirculation gyre are sensitive to both the magnitude of lateral viscosity and the strength of the deep western boundary current (DWBC). In particular, it is shown that bottom vortex stretching induced by a downslope DWBC near the south of the Grand Banks leads to the formation of a cyclonic northern recirculation gyre and keeps the path of the depth-integrated western boundary current downstream of Cape Hatteras separated from the North American coast. Both south of the Grand Banks and at the crossover region of the DWBC and Gulf Stream, the downslope DWBC induces strong bottom downwelling over the steep continental slope, and the magnitude of the bottom downwelling is locally stronger than surface Ekman pumping velocity, providing strong positive vorticity through bottom vortexstretching effects. The bottom vortex-stretching effect is also present in an extensive area in the North Atlantic, and the contribution to the North Atlantic subpolar and subtropical gyres is on the same order as the local surface wind stress curl. Analytic solutions show that the bottom vortex stretching is important near the western boundary only when the continental slope is wider than the Munk frictional layer scale.},

One of the essential problems with most satellite environmental monitoring methods is their sensitivity to atmospheric conditions, in particular cloud cover, which leads to the loss of a signiﬁcant part of data, especially at high latitudes, potentially reducing the quality of observation time series until it is useless. In this paper, we present a toolbox for ﬁlling gaps in remote sensing time-series data based on machine learning algorithms and spatio-temporal statistics. The ﬁrst implemented procedure allows us to ﬁll gaps based on spatial relationships between pixels, obtained from historical time-series. Then, the second procedure is dedicated to ﬁlling the remaining gaps based on the temporal dynamics of each pixel value. The algorithm was tested and veriﬁed on Sentinel-3 SLSTR and Terra MODIS land surface temperature data and under different geographical and seasonal conditions. As a result of validation, it was found that in most cases the error did not exceed 1 ◦C. The algorithm was also veriﬁed for gaps restoration in Terra MODIS derived normalized difference vegetation index and land surface broadband albedo datasets. The software implementation is Python-based and distributed under conditions of GNU GPL 3 license via public repository.},

In this Review, we describe the morphological diversity of Arctic coasts, discuss important drivers of coastal change, explain the specific sensitivity of Arctic coasts to climate change and provide an overview of pan-Arctic shoreline change and its multifaceted impacts. Arctic coastal changes impact the human environment by threatening coastal settlements, infrastructure, cultural sites and archaeological remains. Changing sediment fluxes also impact the natural environment through carbon, nutrient and pollutant release on a magnitude that remains difficult to predict. Increasing transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaboration efforts will build the foundation for identifying sustainable solutions and adaptation strategies to reduce future risks for those living on, working at and visiting the rapidly changing Arctic coast.},

However, explicit impacts to harvesting of traditional resources for coastal Indigenous communities remain largely unquantified, particularly where the primary research questions are posed by the Indigenous community as a result of emerging approaches such as knowledge co-production. Here, we directly link reduced sea ice coverage to decreasing harvesting opportunities for ugruk (bearded seal, Erignathus barbatus) as a component of a partnership among a multidisciplinary team of scientists, Indigenous Elder Advisory Council, and sovereign Indigenous tribe in northwest Alaska, USA. We collaboratively established research questions, coordinated data collection, and interpreted results to understand the causes and consequences of changing ugruk harvests for the community of Qikiqtag˙ruk (Kotzebue). The duration of spring ugruk hunts by the Qikiqtag˙ruŋmiut declined significantly during 2003–2019 due to a shift (∼3 weeks earlier) in the timing of regional sea ice breakup. Harvests now cease ∼26 d earlier than in the past decade. Using historical sea ice records, we further demonstrate that ice coverage in May now resembles conditions that were common in July during the mid-20th century. Overall, we show that climate change is constraining hunting opportunities for this traditional marine resource, although Qikiqtag˙ruŋmiut hunters have so far been able to offset a shortened season with changes in effort. Notwithstanding recent hunting success in unprecedentedly sparse ice conditions, accessibility to traditional resources remains a prominent concern for many Arctic communities. Management and policy decisions related to Arctic marine mammal resources, such as ugruk, are therefore also interwoven with food security, well-being, and culture of Indigenous communities. Hence, research that originates with Indigenous sovereignty over the entire research process, such as demonstrated here, has the potential to also lead to more inclusive, sustainable, and equitable outcomes in the face of rapid and accelerating Arctic change.},

In addition, the Ross Sea is also regarded as a natural laboratory in investigating ice-ocean interactions owing to the development of the polynya. In this article, I introduce characteristics of the Ross Sea described in previous observational studies, and investigate variations that have occurred in the Ross Sea in the past and those taking place in the present. Furthermore, based on these observational results, I outline variations or changes that can be anticipated in the Ross Sea in the future, and make an appeal to researchers regarding the importance and necessity of continuous observations in the Ross Sea.},

In this study, we use the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data to retrieve the time series variations of the GrIS from April 2002 to June 2017. We also estimate the mass balance from the RACMO2.3 and ice discharge data in order to obtain a comparative analysis and cross-validation. A detailed analysis of long-term trend and seasonal and inter-annual changes in the GrIS is implemented by GRACE and surface mass balance (SMB) modeling. The results indicate a decrease of −267.77 ± 8.68 Gt/yr of the GrIS over the 16-year period. There is a rapid decline from 2002 to 2008, which accelerated from 2009 to 2012 before declining relatively slowly from 2013 to 2017. The mass change inland is signiﬁcantly smaller than that detected along coastal regions, especially in the southeastern, southwestern, and northwestern regions. The mass balance estimates from GRACE and SMB minus ice discharge (SMB-D) are very consistent. The ice discharge manifests itself mostly as a long-term trend, whereas seasonal mass variations are largely attributed to surface mass processes. The GrIS mass changes are mostly attributed to mass loss during summer. Summer mass changes are highly correlated with climate changes.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have proposed the Southern Ocean as the site of large water-mass transformations; other studies propose that this basin is among the main drivers for North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) circulation. A modeling contribution toward understanding the role of this basin in the global thermohaline circulation can thus be of interest. In particular, key pathways and transformations associated with the thermohaline circulation in the Southern Ocean of an ice–ocean coupled model have been identified here through the extensive use of quantitative Lagrangian diagnostics. The model Southern Ocean is characterized by a shallow overturning circulation transforming 20 Sv (1 Sv ϵ 106 m3 sϪ1) of thermocline waters into mode waters and a deep overturning related to the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water. Mode and intermediate waters contribute to 80\% of the upper branch of the overturning in the Atlantic Ocean north of 30°S. A net upwelling of 11.5 Sv of Circumpolar Deep Waters is simulated in the Southern Ocean. Antarctic Bottom Water upwells into deep layers in the Pacific basin, forming Circumpolar Deep Water and subsurface thermocline water. The Southern Ocean is a powerful consumer of NADW: about 40\% of NADW net export was found to upwell in the Southern Ocean, and 40\% is transformed into Antarctic Bottom Water. The upwelling occurs south of the Polar Front and mainly in the Indian and Pacific Ocean sectors. The transformation of NADW to lighter water occurs in two steps: vertical mixing at the base of the mixed layer first decreases the salinity of the deep water upwelling south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, followed by heat input by air–sea and diffusive fluxes to complete the transformation to mode and intermediate waters.},

	abstract = {The Ross Sea, one of the most productive regions in the Southern Ocean, plays a signiﬁcant role in deep water formation and carbon cycling. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption and ﬂuorescence (FDOM) properties were studied in conjunction with biophysical properties during austral summer. Elevated values of both DOC (mean 47.82 ± 5.70 µM) and CDOM (absorption coefﬁcient at 325 nm, acdom325: mean 0.31 ± 0.18 m−1) observed in the upper shelf waters in the southwest (SW), north of the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS), the northwest and along a transect inward of the shelf break, suggested in situ production and accumulation linked to the productive spring/summer season. However, regional differences were observed in CDOM with acdom325 higher (0.63 ± 0.19 m−1) and its spectral slope S275−295 lower (24.06 ± 2.93 µm−1) in the SW compared to other regions (0.25 ± 0.08 m−1 and 28.92 ± 2.67 µm−1, respectively). Similarly, the speciﬁc UV absorption coefﬁcient or SUVA254 determined at 254 nm was greater (1.85 ± 0.55 m2 mg−1 C) compared to other regions (1.07 ± 0.24 m2 mg−1 C), indicating CDOM of greater molecular weight and aromaticity in the SW. Phytoplankton absorption spectra indicated the shallow mixed layer of SW Ross Sea to be dominated by diatoms (e.g., Fragilariopsis spp.), a preferential food source for grazers such as the Antarctic krill, which in large numbers have been shown to enhance CDOM absorption, a likely source in the SW. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) ﬂuorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) retrieved one protein-like and two humic-like FDOM fractions commonly observed in the global ocean. In contrast to acdom325 which was uncorrelated to DOC, we observed weak but signiﬁcant positive correlations between the humic-like FDOM with salinity and DOC, high value of the biological index parameter BIX and an instance of increasing FDOM with depth at a location with sinking organic matter, suggesting autochthonous production of FDOM. The absorption budget showed a relatively higher contribution by CDOM (70.7 ± 18.3\%) compared to phytoplankton (22.5 ± 15.2\%) absorption coefﬁcients at 443 nm with implications to ocean color remote sensing. This ﬁrst study of DOM optical properties provides additional insights on carbon cycling in the Ross Sea.},

In regions of dense water formation, transformation of CDW on the shelf limits access of CDW to ice shelves, despite strong onshore CDW heat transport. Elsewhere transformation of CDW on the shelf is weak, implying that temperature on the shelf is limited by heat transport onto the shelf or the offshore heat reservoir.},

We apply Random Forest (RF) and seven other conventional spatial interpolation models to a global Surface Solar Radiation (SSR) data set. We apply three categories of predictors: climatic, spatial, and time series variables. Although the first category is the most common in research, our study shows that it is actually the last two categories that are best suited to predict the response. In fact, the best spatial variable is almost 40 times more important than the best climatic variable in predicting SSR. Furthermore, the 10-fold cross validation shows that the RF has a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 10.2 Wm−2 and a standard deviation of 1.5 Wm−2. On the other hand, the average MAE of the conventional interpolation methods is 21.3 Wm−2, which is more than twice as large as the RF method, in addition to an average standard deviation of 6.4 Wm−2, which is more than four times larger than the RF standard deviation. This highlights the benefits of using machine learning in environmental research.},

This issue has potential implications for numerical simulations of ice-sheet dynamics, especially in regions prone to instability where detailed knowledge of the topography, including ﬁne-scale roughness, is required. Here, we present a high-resolution (100 m) synthetic bed elevation terrain for Antarctica, encompassing the continent, continental shelf, and seas south of 60◦ S. Although not identically matching observations, the synthetic bed surface – denoted as HRES – preserves topographic roughness characteristics of airborne and ground-based ice-penetrating radar data measured by the ICECAP (Investigating the Cryospheric Evolution of the Central Antarctic Plate) consortium or used to create the Bedmap1 compilation. Broad-scale ({\textgreater} 5 km resolution) features of the Antarctic landscape are incorporated using a low-pass ﬁlter of the Bedmap2 bed elevation data. HRES has applicability in high-resolution ice-sheet modelling studies, including investigations of the interaction between topography, ice-sheet dynamics, and hydrology, where processes are highly sensitive to bed elevations and ﬁne-scale roughness.

Absorbed short-wave radiation may also be slightly overestimated due to an underestimation of the snow albedo, and this inﬂuences the surface energy budget and atmospheric turbulence.

	abstract = {Abstract. In order to understand the evolution of the climate of Antarctica, dominant processes that control surface and low-atmosphere meteorology need to be accurately captured in climate models. We used the regional climate model MAR (v3.11) at 10 km horizontal resolution, forced by ERA5 reanalysis over a 9-year period (2010–2018), to study the impact of drifting snow (designing here the wind-driven transport of snow particles below and above 2 m) on the near-surface atmosphere and surface in Adelie Land, East Antarctica. Two model runs were performed, respectively with and without drifting snow, and compared to half-hourly in situ observations at D17, a coastal and windy location of Adelie Land. We show that sublimation of drifting-snow particles in the atmosphere drives the difference between model runs and is responsible for significant impacts on the near-surface atmosphere. By cooling the low atmosphere and increasing its relative humidity, drifting snow also reduces sensible and latent heat exchanges at the surface (−5.9 W m−2 on average). Moreover, large and dense drifting-snow layers act as near-surface cloud by interacting with incoming radiative fluxes, enhancing incoming longwave radiations and reducing incoming shortwave radiations in summer (net radiative forcing: 5.9 W m−2). Even if drifting snow modifies these processes involved in surface-atmosphere interactions, the total surface energy budget is only slightly modified by introducing drifting snow, because of compensating effects in surface energy fluxes. The drifting-snow driven effects are not prominent near the surface but peak higher in the boundary layer (fifth vertical level, 38 m) where drifting snow sublimation is the most pronounced. Accounting for drifting snow in MAR generally improves the comparison at D17, more especially for the representation of relative humidity (mean bias reduced from −11.1 \% to 2.9 \%) and incoming longwave radiation (mean bias reduced from −7.6 W m−2 to −1.5 W m−2). Consequently, our results suggest that a detailed representation of drifting-snow processes is required in climate models to better capture the near–surface meteorology and surface–atmosphere interactions in coastal Adelie Land.},

We use a global sea ice–ocean model to show that a wall shielding the Amundsen Sea below 350 m depth successfully suppresses the inﬂow of warm water and reduces ice shelf melting. However, these warm water masses get redirected towards neighboring ice shelves, which reduces the net effectiveness of the wall.

	abstract = {The outer Ross Sea continental shelf has experienced large variations in ice sheet extent over the Pleistocene that are theorized to be largely driven by changes in the westward-ﬂowing Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) at the continental shelf break. This current regulates southward incursions of warm modiﬁed Circumpolar Water, and it is thought to have triggered past marine ice sheet retreat. Additionally, expansions of grounded ice sheets on the continental shelf have fundamentally altered the Ross Sea water mass formation processes, inﬂuencing surface water salinity, sea ice cover, nutrient utilization, deep-water ventilation, and primary productivity. Here, we report the geochemical, physical properties, grain size, bulk d15N, and diatom records during the late Pleistocene from two sediment cores from the Iselin Bank on the outermost continental shelf in the Ross Sea. These core sites were not overridden by grounded ice sheets during the late Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, allowing for a continuous archive of glacimarine environments that were inﬂuenced by the ASC. Interglacial periods are typically characterized by high surface water productivity and nutrient utilization, with Chaetoceros resting spores indicating nutrient limitation under open ocean conditions, and glacial periods are typically characterized by low surface water productivity and nutrient utilization, with sea ice diatoms and planktonic foraminifers indicating light limitation under extensive sea ice/ice margin proximal conditions. A grain size analysis indicates coarse-skewed distributions and winnowing in the Iselin Bank region during cold periods. The winnowing may be related to enhanced ASC ﬂow instead of density driven shelf water outﬂow.},

Thwaites Glacier flows across the tectonic fabric of the West Antarctic rift system with its bedrock highs and sedimentary basins. Swath radar and seismic surveys of the glacier bed have revealed soft-sediment flutes 100 m or more high extending 15 km or more across basins downglacier from bedrock highs. Flutes end at prominent hard-bedded moats on stoss sides of the next topographic highs. We use simple models to show that ice flow against topography increases pressure between ice and till upglacier along the bed over a distance that scales with the topography. In this basal zone of high pressure, ice-contact water would be excluded, thus increasing basal drag by increasing ice-till coupling and till flux, removing till to allow bedrock erosion that creates moats. Till carried across highlands would then be deposited in lee-side positions forming bedforms that prograde downglacier over time, and that remain soft on top through feedbacks that match till-deformational fluxes from well upglacier of the topography. The bedforms of the part of Thwaites surveyed here are prominent because ice flow has persisted over a long time on this geological setting, not because ice flow is anomalous. Bedform development likely has caused evolution of ice flow over time as till and lubricating water were redistributed, moats were eroded and bedforms grew.},

              A 3-year record of weekly snow water equivalent (SWE) accumulation at Summit Camp, central Greenland ice sheet, obtained by direct sampling, is presented. While the overall SWE accumulation of 24.2 cm w.e. a
              −1
              matches long-term ice core estimates, variability increases at shorter timescales. Half of the annual SWE accumulation occurs during a few large events, with the average accumulation rate decreasing 35\% between the first and second halves of the record coinciding with exceptional anticyclonic conditions in the spring and summer of 2019. No seasonality in accumulation is detected. Rather, local accumulation rates appear to be significantly impacted by wind redistribution that obscures temporal patterns in snowfall. Surface snow density is consistent, on average, with previously measured values but does not correlate with near surface temperature or wind speed. Two surface mass balance reanalysis models significantly underestimate accumulation rates at Summit Camp. This is concerning because such models are often used to estimate ice-sheet mass loss.},

Here, we develop a new glacier model constrained by GRACE gravimetry observations for the period between 2002 and 2017. The high temporal and regional spatial resolution of GRACE mass balance estimates allows us to estimate regional glacier sensitivities to atmospheric changes, and account for higher order of glacier dynamics. We use our regionally constrained models to extrapolate future mass loss under different climate emission scenarios. Generally our 21st century sea level estimates are at the high end compared to other studies. We find that the Gulf of Alaska exhibits the highest mass loss rates between \&minus;79 to \&minus;112\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$ between 2006 and 2100 under different scenarios, and displays the highest sensitivity to the specific scenario (RCP 2.6/4.5/8.5). Our estimates for Baffin Island are significantly higher than prior work (\&minus;57 to \&minus;85\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$) and are comparable to projected mass loss rates from the Ellesmere region (\&minus;63 to \&minus;101\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The super-resolution deep convolutional neural network model is trained on scattered regions in Antarctica where high-resolution (250\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}m{\textless}/span{\textgreater}) ground-truth bed elevation grids are available. This model is then used to generate high-resolution bed topography in less surveyed areas.

It takes in additional high-spatial-resolution datasets, such as ice surface elevation, velocity and snow accumulation, to better inform the bed topography even in the absence of ice thickness data from direct ice-penetrating-radar surveys. The DeepBedMap model is based on an adapted architecture of the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network, chosen to minimize per-pixel elevation errors while producing realistic topography. The final product is a four-times-upsampled (250\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}m{\textless}/span{\textgreater}) bed elevation model of Antarctica that can be used by glaciologists interested in the subglacial terrain and by ice sheet modellers wanting to run catchment- or continent-scale ice sheet model simulations.

Outlet glaciers particularly susceptible to basal slip over deformable subglacial sediments include Jakobshavn, Helheim and Kangerdlussuaq, while geothermal warming and softening of basal ice may affect the onset of faster ice flow at Petermann Glacier and the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream. Interactions with the solid earth therefore control the past, present and future dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet and must be adequately explored and implemented in ice sheet models.},

We use radar sounding and marine bathymetry data to compare the bed configuration of Thwaites Glacier to the bed of paleo-Pine Island Glacier. Using observed and modeled radar scattering, we show that the tributaries and upper trunk of Thwaites Glacier are underlain by ice flow-aligned bedforms consistent with deformable sediment and that the lower trunk is grounded on a region of high bed roughness consistent with outcropping bedrock.

While ‘definite lakes’ can be identified readily by high bed reflectivity in radar sounding, the identification and characterization of less distinct subglacial lakes and water systems with radar sounding are complicated by variable radio-wave attenuation in the overlying ice. When relying on repeat elevation observations, the relatively short times series and biased distribution of elevation observations, along with the episodic nature of ‘active lake’ outflow and replenishment, limit our understanding of how water flows under the ice sheet. Using recently developed methods for quantifying the radar scattering behaviour of the basal interface of the ice, we can avoid the problem of attenuation, and observe the plumbing of the subglacial landscape. In West Antarctica's Ross Sea Embayment, we confirm that extensive distributed water systems underlie these ice streams. Distributed water sheets are upstream in the onset regions of fast flow, while canal systems underly downstream regions of fast flow. In East Antarctica, we use specularity analysis to recover substantial hydraulic connectivity extending beyond previous knowledge, connecting the lakes already delineated by traditional radar sounding or surface elevation transients.},

Self-affinity implies that the standard deviation measured on a sample spanning a length w is proportional to wH = w2 − D, where H is the Hurst exponent and D is the fractal dimension (1 ≤ D ≤2 for a fractal series). In this paper, a “roughness-length” method based on this property of self-affine series is presented. In practice, the root-mean-square roughness is computed in a number of windows of varying length w, and H is measured from the slope of a log-log plot of roughness versus w. Montecarlo simulations show that the fractal dimension as measured by the roughness-length method is approximately the same as that defined by the power spectrum. The roughness-length method is closely related to the grid fractal dimension, is simple to implement, and can be applied to non-uniformly spaced series.},

Various methods have been employed, such as the ‘two-parameter’ technique that considers vertical and slope irregularities in topography, but they struggle to incorporate roughness at multiple spatial scales leading to a breakdown in their depiction of bed roughness where the relief is most complex. In this article, we describe a new algorithm, analogous to wavelet transformations, to quantify the bed roughness at multiple scales. The ‘Self-Adaptive Two-Parameter’ system calculates the roughness of a bed profile using a frequency-domain method, allowing the extraction of three characteristic factors: (1) slope, (2) skewness and (3) coefficient of variation. The multi-scale roughness is derived by weighted-summing of these frequency-related factors. We use idealized bed elevations to initially validate the algorithm, and then actual bed-elevation data are used to compare the new roughness index with other methods. We show the new technique is an effective tool for quantifying bed roughness from radar data, paving the way for improved continental-wide depictions of bed roughness and incorporation of this information into ice flow models.},

Yet, there is considerable debate around their continuing role in the future. Frequently mentioned as limitations of GCMs are the structural error and uncertainty across models with different representations of unresolved scales; and the fact that the models are tuned to reproduce certain aspects of the observed Earth. We consider these shortcomings in the context of a future generation of models that may address these issues through substantially higher resolution and detail, or through the use of machine learning techniques to match them better to observations, theory, and process models. It is our contention that calibration, far from being a weakness of models, is an essential element in the simulation of complex systems, and contributes to our understanding of their inner workings. Models can be calibrated to reveal both fine-scale detail, or the global response to external perturbations. New methods enable us to articulate and improve the connections between the different levels of abstract representation of climate processes, and our understanding resides in an entire hierarchy of models where GCMs will continue to play a central role for the foreseeable future..},

They were complemented by CTDs taken along the continental slope during the Norwegian FRAM 2014\&ndash;2015 drift. The CTD profiles are used to reveal the origin of water masses and interactions with ambient water from the continental slope and the tidewater glacier outlet. The subsurface water is associated with the Pacific water outflow from the Arctic Ocean. The underlying halocline separates the Pacific water from a deeper layer of polar water that has interacted with the warm Atlantic water outflow through the Fram Strait, recorded below 140 m. Over the outer shelf, the halocline shows numerous cold density-compensated intrusions indicating lateral interaction with an ambient polar water mass across the continental slope. At the front of the tidewater glacier outlet, colder and turbid water intrusions were observed at the base of the halocline. On the temperature\&ndash;salinity plots these stations indicate a mixing line that is different from the ambient water and seems to be conditioned by the ocean\&ndash;glacier interaction. Our observations of Pacific water are set within the context of upstream observations in the Beaufort Sea and downstream observations from the Northeast Water Polynya, and clearly show the modification of Pacific water during its advection across the Arctic Ocean. Moreover, ambient water over the Wandel Sea slope shows different thermohaline structures indicating the different origin and pathways of the on-shore and off-shore branches of the Arctic Ocean outflow through the western Fram Strait.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These measurements indicate a complex relationship between the ocean tides and currents, basal conditions and ice-stream flow. Both the mean basal seismicity and the velocity of the ice stream are modulated by the tides. Seismic activity increases twice during each semi-diurnal tidal cycle. The tidal analysis shows the largest velocity variation is at the fortnightly period, with smaller variations superimposed at diurnal and semi-diurnal frequencies. The general pattern of the observed velocity is two velocity peaks during each semi-diurnal tidal cycle, but sometimes three peaks are observed. This pattern of two or three peaks is more regular during spring tides, when the largest-amplitude velocity variations are observed, than during neap tides. This is the first time that velocity and level of seismicity are shown to correlate and respond to tidal forcing as far as 40 km upstream from the grounding line of a large ice stream.},

	abstract = {When we are faced with challenging image classification tasks, we often explain our reasoning by dissecting the image, and pointing out prototypical aspects of one class or another. The mounting evidence for each of the classes helps us make our final decision. In this work, we introduce a deep network architecture -- prototypical part network (ProtoPNet), that reasons in a similar way: the network dissects the image by finding prototypical parts, and combines evidence from the prototypes to make a final classification. The model thus reasons in a way that is qualitatively similar to the way ornithologists, physicians, and others would explain to people on how to solve challenging image classification tasks. The network uses only image-level labels for training without any annotations for parts of images. We demonstrate our method on the CUB-200-2011 dataset and the Stanford Cars dataset. Our experiments show that ProtoPNet can achieve comparable accuracy with its analogous non-interpretable counterpart, and when several ProtoPNets are combined into a larger network, it can achieve an accuracy that is on par with some of the best-performing deep models. Moreover, ProtoPNet provides a level of interpretability that is absent in other interpretable deep models.},

We observed a distinct north-south division in the water mass distribution in west Greenland, approximately partitioned by the northern part of Davis Strait, and a division between the continental slope and fjord entrances. Waters from the regional southern freshwater source with origin in the East Greenland Current that rounds Cape Farewell are not observed to enter Baffin Bay. The regional heat source transported by the West Greenland Current is blocked by Southwest Greenland Coastal Water in the south but the deep connections in the north allow warm deep Subpolar Mode Water to enter fjords. Furthermore, we observed cold and relative saline Baffin Bay Polar Water over the inner part of the banks, periodically reaching as far south as 64°N, suggesting the presence of an undescribed southward current at the Southwest Greenland continental shelf.},

	abstract = {A method for infering bed topography beneath glaciers from surface measurements (elevation from altimetry and velocity from InSAR) and sparse thickness measurements is developed and evaluated. The method is based on an original non-isothermal Reduced Uncertainty (RU) version of the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) equation that natively incorporates the surface measurements. The flow model has a single dimensionless multi-physics parameter γ. This parameter takes into account the basal slipperiness and the variable vertical rate factor profiles, thus the vertical thermal variations. The inversions are based on three steps involving: an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and two Variational Data Assimilation (VDA) processes. The ANN-based stage aims at estimating the multi-physics number γ from the thickness measurements; the resulting estimator is remarkably robust. The full inversion method is valid for half-sheared flows (presenting a moderate basal slipperiness): it can be applied to inland ice-sheets areas. Also these estimates connect continuously with estimates from mass conservation only, i.e. with areas of sliding flows. Numerical results are presented for areas of the East Antarctica Ice Sheet where bed elevation can be very uncertain (Bedmap2 values). Estimates are valid for wavelengths longer than \${\textbackslash}sim 10 {\textbackslash}bar h\$(due to the long wave assumption, shallow flow model) with resolution at \${\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}bar h\$(\${\textbackslash}bar h\$a characteristic thickness value).},

Failing to find these distributions that are required as initial conditions leads to a disequilibrium between mass balance and ice flow, resulting in nonphysical transient effects in the prognostic model. Here we tackle this problem by inverting an emulator of the Stokes ice flow model based on deep learning. By substituting the ice flow equations using a convolutional neural network emulator, we simplify, make more robust and dramatically speed up the solving of the underlying optimization problem thanks to automatic differentiation, stochastic gradient methods and implementation of graphics processing unit (GPU). We demonstrate this process by simultaneously inferring the ice thickness distribution, ice flow parametrization and ice surface of ten of the largest glaciers in Switzerland. As a result, we obtain a high degree of assimilation while guaranteeing an equilibrium between mass-balance and ice flow mechanics. The code runs very efficiently (optimizing one large-size glacier at 100 m takes {\textless} 1 min on a laptop) while it is open-source and publicly available.},

In response to recent climatic and oceanic change, ice shelves fringing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) have begun to fragment and retreat, with major implications for ice-sheet stability. Here, we focus on the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf (TEIS), the remaining pinned floating extension of Thwaites Glacier. We show that TEIS has undergone a process of fragmentation in the last 5 years, including brittle failure along a major shear zone, formation of tensile cracks on the main body of the shelf, and a release of tabular bergs on both the eastern and western flanks. Simulations with the Helsinki Discrete Element Model (HiDEM) show that this pattern of failure is associated with high backstress from a submarine pinning point at the distal edge of the shelf. We show that a significant zone of shear, upstream of the main pinning point, developed in response to the rapid acceleration of the shelf between 2002 and 2006, seeding damage on the shelf. Subsequently, basal melting and positive feedback between damage and strain rates weakened TEIS, allowing damage to accumulate. Thus, although backstress on TEIS has likely diminished over time as the pinning point shrunk, accumulation of damage has ensured that the ice in the shear zone remained the weakest link in the system. Experiments with the BISICLES ice-sheet model indicate that additional damage to or unpinning of TEIS is unlikely to trigger significantly increased ice loss from WAIS, but the calving response to the loss of TEIS remains highly uncertain. It is widely recognised that ice-shelf fragmentation and collapse can be triggered by hydrofracturing and/or unpinning from ice-shelf margins or grounding points. Our results indicate a third mechanism, \textit{backstress triggered failure}, that can occur if and when an ice shelf is no longer able to withstand stress imposed by pinning points. In most circumstances, pinning points are essential for ice-shelf stability, but as ice shelves thin and weaken, the concentration of backstress in damaged ice upstream of a pinning point may provide the seeds of their demise.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Rapid mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is affecting sea level and, through increased freshwater and sediment discharge, ocean circulation, sea-ice, biogeochemistry, and marine ecosystems around Greenland. Key to interpreting ongoing and projecting future ice loss, and its impact on the ocean, is understanding exchanges of heat, freshwater, and nutrients that occur at the GrIS marine margins. Processes governing these exchanges are not well understood because of limited observations from the regions where glaciers terminate into the ocean and the challenge of modeling the spatial and temporal scales involved. Thus, notwithstanding their importance, ice sheet/ocean exchanges are poorly represented or not accounted for in models used for projection studies. Widespread community consensus maintains that concurrent and long-term records of glaciological, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters at the ice sheet/ocean margins are key to addressing this knowledge gap by informing understanding, and constraining and validating models. Through a series of workshops and documents endorsed by the community-at-large, a framework for an international, collaborative, Greenland Ice sheet-Ocean Observing System (GrIOOS), that addresses the needs of society in relation to a changing GrIS, has been proposed. This system would consist of a set of ocean, glacier, and atmosphere essential variables to be collected at a number of diverse sites around Greenland for a minimum of two decades. Internationally agreed upon data protocols and data sharing policies would guarantee uniformity and availability of the information for the broader community. Its development, maintenance, and funding will require close international collaboration. Engagement of end-users, local people, and groups already active in these areas, as well as synergy with ongoing, related, or complementary networks will be key to its success and effectiveness.},

The Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) between the geodetic GNSS-R sea levels and OTT RLS records is 3.43 cm, with a correlation of 0.96. In addition, the complex differences between the OTT RLS records and 15-min GNSS-R sea levels using Global Positioning System (GPS) and Globalnaya Navigazionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema (or Global Navigation Satellite System; GLONASS) signals for all the eight major tidal constituents are in mm-level agreement.

The line-of-sight signal and its coherent surface reflection signal are not separate observables in geodetic GNSS-R. The temporally constructive and destructive oscillations in the recorded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations can be used to retrieve water-surface levels at intermediate spatial scales that are proportional to the height of the GNSS antenna above the water surface. In this contribution, SNR observations are used to retrieve water levels at the Vianden Pumped Storage Plant (VPSP) in Luxembourg, where the water-surface level abruptly changes up to 17 m every 4-8 h to generate a peak current when the energy demand increases. The GNSS-R water level retrievals are corrected for the vertical velocity and acceleration of the water surface. The vertical velocity and acceleration corrections are important corrections that mitigate systematic errors in the estimated water level, especially for VPSP with such large water-surface changes. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the 10-min multi-GNSS water level time series and water level gauge records is 7.0 cm for a one-year period, with a 0.999 correlation coefficient. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-R can be used as a new complementary approach to study hurricanes or storm surges that cause abnormal rises of water levels.},

	abstract = {We retrieve sea levels in polar regions via GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R), using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations from eight POLENET GNSS stations. Although geodetic-quality antennas are designed to boost the direct reception from GNSS satellites and to suppress indirect reflections from natural surfaces, the latter can still be used to estimate the sea level in a stable terrestrial reference frame. Here, typical GNSS-R retrieval methodology is improved in two ways, 1) constraining phase-shifts to yield more precise reflector heights and 2) employing an extended dynamic filter to account for the second-order height rate of change (vertical acceleration). We validate retrievals over a 4-year period at Palmer Station (Antarctica), where there is a co-located tide gauge (TG). Because ice contaminates the long-period tidal constituents, we focus on the main tidal species (daily and subdaily), by employing a deseasonalization filter. The difference between sub-hourly GNSS-R retrievals of the ocean surface and TG records has a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 15.4 cm and a correlation of 0.903, while the tidal prediction has a RMSE of 1.9 cm and a correlation of 0.998. There is excellent millimetric agreement between the two sensors for most eight major tidal constituents, with the exception of luni-solar diurnal (K1), principal solar (S2), and luni-solar semidiurnal (K2) components, which are biased in GNSS-R due to the leakage of the GPS orbital period. We also compare the GNSS-R tidal constituents from seven additional POLENET sites, without co-located TG, to global and local ocean tide models. We find that the root-sum-square-error (RSSE) of eight major constituents varies between 26.0 cm and 56.9 cm for different models. Given that the agreement in tidal constituents between the TG and GNSS-R was better at Palmer Station, we conclude that assimilating the GNSS-R retrievals into tidal models would improve their accuracy in Antarctica and Greenland, provided that care is exercised to avoid the orbital period overtones and also sea ice.},

	abstract = {Abstract Bathymetric sills are important features in the ocean-filled cavities beneath a few fast-retreating ice shelves in West Antarctica and northern Greenland. The sills can be high enough to obstruct the cavity circulation and thereby modulate glacial melt rates. This study focuses on the idealized problem of diabatically driven, sill-constrained overturning circulation in a cavity. The circulation beneath fast-melting ice shelves can generally be characterized by an inflow of relatively warm dense water (with temperatures of a few degrees Celsius above the local freezing point) at depth and cold, less-dense, outflowing water, which exhibits an approximately two-layer structure in observations. We use a two-layer isopycnal hydrostatic model to study the cross-sill exchange of these waters in ice shelf cavities wide enough to be rotationally dominated. A quasigeostrophic constraint is determined for the transport imposed by the stratification. Relative to this constraint, the key parameters controlling the transport and its variability are the sill height relative to the bottom layer thickness and the strength of the friction relative to the potential vorticity (PV) gradient imposed by the sill. By varying these two key parameters, we simulate a diversity of flow phenomena. For a given meridional pressure gradient, the cross-sill transport is controlled by sill height beyond a critical threshold in the eddy-permitting, low-friction regime, while it is insensitive to friction in both the low-friction and high-friction regimes. We present theoretical ideas to explain the flow characteristics: a Stommel boundary layer for the friction-dominated regime; mean–eddy PV balances and energy conversion in the low-friction, low-sill regime; and hydraulic control in the low-friction, high-sill regime, with various estimates for transport in each of these regimes.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a monitoring system for area-wide ﬂow-velocity ﬁelds of the outlet glaciers of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) utilizing the freely available Landsat archive. In order to process this large amount of satellite images an almost automatic monitoring system was developed. With the Global Digital Elevation Map V2 (GDEM-V2) of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer (ASTER) an improved orthorectiﬁcation was applied which, in combination with a destriping correction of the Landsat 7 products with Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure, leads to more precise ﬂow-velocity information. In addition, outliers were removed using an adaptive, recursive ﬁlter approach. For the time span 1972–2012 more than 100,000 ﬂowvelocity ﬁelds were derived from over 16,000 optical multi-sensoral Landsat scenes (Landsat 1 to Landsat 7) allowing the determination of the long-term ﬂow-velocity trend. Moreover, the high temporal resolution facilitates the analysis of seasonal ﬂow-velocity variations of numerous outlet glaciers. For many of the major outlet glaciers the results show an acceleration pattern that is consistent with most of the previously published analyses. However, the ﬂow-velocity changes do not have a uniform pattern in their temporal and spatial distribution. This study provides both a high temporal densiﬁcation and an extension of existing ﬂow-velocity information of the GrIS margin. Finally, this processing chain in its generality allows for the determination of various types of surface displacements and can be applied to other glacier regions.},
