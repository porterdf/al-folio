Flying high and fast (&gt; 40,000 ft), the transit to Antarctica takes at least 2.5 hours. This means allows for up to 5 hours of survey time depending on the sector, which is a considerable amount of new data. Shown in one example of a flight track, plotted over the speed of glacier ice (rainbow colors). This particular mission, Cook-Ninnis, includes flying over its namesake ice shelves and glaciers, collecting crucial gravity and radar data for use in bathymetry inversions.</p> <p><br/><img src="/assets/img/NASA_OIB_ANT-2019_FullGravity_CSYMBmap.png"/><br/></p> <p>At the end of the 5+ weeks of surveying whenever weather and crew rest allowed, this is all the new gravity data collected aboard the GV. Note that we run the gravimeters during transit, since ‘high-and-fast’ gravity data is still useful to many communities. Looking at this map and all the new data collected, it’s clear that this final OIB season was a huge success.</p>
